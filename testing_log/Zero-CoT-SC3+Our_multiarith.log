A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down to make it easier to understand:

1. Carol picked 29 carrots.
2. Her mom picked 16 carrots.
3. The total number of good carrots they picked is 38 (29 + 16 = 45, but only 38 are good).
4. To find the number of bad carrots, subtract the total number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked:

Total number of carrots picked = 29 (Carol) + 16 (Mom) = 45
Good carrots = 38

Bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots
Bad carrots = 45 - 38
Bad carrots = 7

Therefore, Carol and her mom have 7 bad carrots.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, to figure out how many shirts Ned didn't wash, we first determine the total number of shirts Ned had to wash. Adding the number of short sleeve and long sleeve shirts gives us a total of 9 + 21 = 30 shirts. If Ned only managed to wash 29 shirts by the time school started, then the number of shirts he didn't wash is 30 - 29 = 1 shirt. Therefore, Ned did not wash 1 shirt.

Q: While on vacation, Debby took 24 pictures at the zoo and 12 at the museum. If she later deleted 14 of the pictures, how many pictures from her vacation did she still have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, we need to calculate the total number of pictures Debby took on her vacation. 
Debby took 24 pictures at the zoo and 12 pictures at the museum, so the total number of pictures she took initially is 24 + 12 = 36 pictures. 

Next, we need to consider the 14 pictures that she later deleted. 
If we subtract the 14 pictures she deleted from the 36 pictures she initially took, we can determine how many pictures she still had after deleting them. 

Therefore, the number of pictures Debby still had from her vacation after deleting some is 36 - 14 = 22 pictures. 

So, Debby still had 22 pictures from her vacation after deleting some.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 22

Q: For the school bake sale Paige made pastries. She baked 36 cupcakes and 9 cookies. After the sale she had 4 to take back home. How many pastries did she sell?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step to figure out the total number of pastries Paige sold:

1. Total number of pastries Paige made:
   cupcakes = 36
   cookies = 9

2. Total number of pastries Paige made altogether:
   total pastries = cupcakes + cookies
                 = 36 + 9
                 = 45 pastries

3. Paige took 4 pastries back home:
   pastries taken back home = 4

4. Total pastries Paige sold:
   pastries sold = total pastries - pastries taken back home
                = 45 - 4
                = 41 pastries

Therefore, Paige sold 41 pastries at the school bake sale.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 41

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! To calculate how many good games Edward ended up with, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Edward initially bought 41 games from his friend.
2. Then, he bought 14 more games at a garage sale.
3. So, the total number of games he acquired is 41 + 14 = 55 games.
4. Out of these 55 games, 31 didn't work and were discarded.
5. Therefore, to find the number of good games he ended up with, we subtract the non-working games from the total number of games acquired: 55 - 31 = 24 good games.

Thus, Edward ended up with 24 good games after buying 41 games from a friend and 14 games at a garage sale, despite 31 of them not working.

Sure! Let's break it down step by step. Originally, Edward had 41 games from his friend. Then, he bought 14 more at a garage sale. 

So, the total number of games Edward had before any issues was:
41 (from friend) + 14 (from garage sale) = 55 games

But 31 of the games didn't work, which means that Edward had to discard those. 

Therefore, the number of good games Edward ended up with would be:
Total games acquired - Games that didn't work
55 - 31 = 24 good games

So, Edward ended up with 24 good games after acquiring 41 from his friend, buying 14 more at a garage sale, and encountering 31 that didn't work.

Q: Emily was playing a trivia game. In the first round she scored 16 points and in the second round she scored 33 points. In the last round she lost 48 points. How many points did she have at the end of the game?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
In this case, we can calculate Emily's final score by adding her scores from the first two rounds and then subtracting the points she lost in the last round.

Emily's final score = (16 points + 33 points) - 48 points
Emily's final score = 49 points - 48 points
Emily's final score = 1 point

Therefore, Emily had 1 point at the end of the game.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1

Q: The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 21 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples, totalling 33 + 23 = 56 apples. 
Since each student wanted only 1 fruit, then for 21 students, the total fruits needed are 21 apples. 
The extra apples left are calculated by subtracting the consumed apples from the total ordered apples: 56 - 21 = 35 extra apples. 
Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 35.

Q: The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 21 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we'll first calculate the total number of apples they ordered (red and green together), then subtract the number of apples the 21 students consumed.

1. Total number of red and green apples ordered = 33 red apples + 23 green apples = 56 apples
2. Number of apples consumed by 21 students = 21 students
3. Number of extra apples = Total apples ordered - Apples consumed by students
4. Extra apples = 56 apples - 21 students = 35 apples

So, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples after 21 students consumed their share!

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 35

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. The school cafeteria ordered:
- 33 red apples
- 23 green apples

2. The total number of apples ordered is:
33 red apples + 23 green apples = 56 apples

3. If only 21 students wanted fruit, and the cafeteria ordered 56 apples, we need to subtract the amount of apples consumed:
56 apples - 21 students = 35 apples remaining

4. To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with:
35 apples remaining - (33 red apples + 23 green apples) = 35 - 56 = -21

Since the result is negative, it means that the cafeteria ended up short of 21 apples, and they would need to order more to meet the demand of 21 students.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 21

Q: Dave had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 20 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! To determine the final quantity of shirts Dave did not wash, let's start by adding up the total number of shirts he needed to wash:

9 short sleeve shirts + 27 long sleeve shirts = 36 total shirts

Since Dave only washed 20 of the shirts before school started, the number of shirts he did not wash can be found by subtracting the shirts he washed from the total number:

36 total shirts - 20 washed shirts = 16 shirts Dave did not wash

Therefore, Dave did not wash 16 shirts before school started.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16.

Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

Sam initially bought 13 adventure books and 17 mystery books, so he acquired a total of 13 + 17 = 30 books.

If 15 of the books were used, we need to subtract this quantity from the total books to find out how many books are left. So, 30 total books - 15 used books = 15 books remaining.

Since the question is asking specifically for new books, we need to consider that the 15 books remaining include both the new ones and the ones that were used. To determine how many new books Sam bought, we just need to subtract the used books from the remaining books. So, 15 remaining books - 15 used books = 0 new books.

Therefore, Sam did not buy any new books after 15 of the total books were used.

Q: Emily was playing a trivia game. In the first round she scored 16 points and in the second round she scored 33 points. In the last round she lost 48 points. How many points did she have at the end of the game?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many points Emily had at the end of the game.

1. In the first round, Emily scored 16 points.
2. In the second round, she scored 33 points.
   
Now, let's add up the points she scored in the first two rounds:
16 points (from the first round) + 33 points (from the second round) = 49 points

So, after the first two rounds, Emily had 49 points.

3. In the last round, she lost 48 points.

To find out how many points Emily had at the end of the game, we subtract the points she lost in the last round from the total points she had after the first two rounds:
49 points (total after first two rounds) - 48 points (lost in the last round) = 1 point

Therefore, Emily had 1 point at the end of the game.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Emily scored 16 points in the first round, 33 points in the second round, and then lost 48 points in the last round.

So, to find the total number of points Emily has at the end of the game, we need to add up her points in the first two rounds and then subtract the points she lost in the last round.

16 points + 33 points - 48 points = -48 + 16 + 33 = 1

Therefore, Emily had 1 point at the end of the game.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! Initially, the cafeteria ordered 33 red apples + 23 green apples = 56 apples in total. If only 21 students wanted fruit, this means that 21 apples were consumed, leaving 56 total apples - 21 consumed apples = 35 apples remaining. Thus, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 35.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples, totaling 33 + 23 = 56 apples.
2. If only 21 students wanted fruit, and each student received an apple, then 21 apples were consumed.
3. The cafeteria started with 56 apples and 21 were consumed, which leaves 56 - 21 = 35 apples remaining.
4. Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples (35 - 21 = 14 red apples and 21 - 21 = 0 green apples) after serving the 21 students.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14 red apples and 0 green apples.

Q: The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 42 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! 
First, let's calculate the total number of apples purchased: 8 red apples + 43 green apples = 51 apples. 
Next, considering that only 42 students wanted fruit, we can determine how many apples were used: 42 apples consumed. 
Therefore, to find out how many extra apples were left, we can subtract the number of apples consumed from the total number purchased: 51 total apples - 42 consumed apples = 9 extra apples remaining. 
So, the cafeteria ended up with 9 extra apples.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

Q: Edward started his own lawn mowing business. In the spring he made 2 dollars mowing lawns and in the summer he made 27 dollars. If he had to spend 5 dollars buying supplies, how much money did he end up with?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Let's break down the information provided:
- Edward made $2 mowing lawns in the spring.
- He made $27 mowing lawns in the summer.
- He spent $5 buying supplies.

To find out how much money he ended up with, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract the amount spent on supplies.

Total earnings = $2 (spring) + $27 (summer)
Total earnings = $29

Money remaining after spending on supplies = Total earnings - Cost of supplies
Money remaining = $29 - $5
Money remaining = $24

Therefore, Edward ended up with $24 after deducting the cost of supplies.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $24

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. In total, there were 17 girls and 32 boys trying out for the basketball team. So, the total number of students who tried out initially is 17 + 32 = 49 students.

2. Out of these 49 students, only 10 got called back, which means that the remaining students did not make the cut. To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we subtract the number of students who did make the cut from the total number who initially tried out:

49 total students - 10 students called back = 39 students who didn't make the cut.

Therefore, 39 students didn't make the cut and were not selected for the basketball team.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 39

Q: For Halloween Katie and her sister combined the candy they received. Katie had 10 pieces of candy while her sister had 6. If they ate 9 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Katie had 10 pieces of candy and her sister had 6 pieces. So, they had a total of 10 + 6 = 16 pieces of candy.

Q: A pet store had 15 siamese cats and 49 house cats. During a sale they sold 19 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! Let's break down the information given.

Initially, the pet store had 15 Siamese cats and 49 house cats:

15 Siamese cats + 49 house cats = 64 total cats

During the sale, they sold 19 cats. To find out how many cats are left, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total:

64 total cats - 19 cats sold = 45 cats left

Therefore, the pet store has 45 cats left after selling 19 cats during the sale.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45

Q: A pet store had 15 siamese cats and 49 house cats. During a sale they sold 19 cats. How many cats do they have left?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! To find out how many cats the pet store has left after selling 19 cats, we first determine the total number of cats they had initially, which is the sum of Siamese cats and house cats.

Initially:
Siamese cats = 15
House cats = 49

Total cats initially = 15 + 49 = 64

After the sale, 19 cats were sold. So the number of cats left is the total initial cats minus the cats sold:

Cats left = Total initial cats - Cats sold
Cats left = 64 - 19
Cats left = 45

Therefore, the pet store has 45 cats left after selling 19 cats.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially in the pet store:
- Siamese cats: 15
- House cats: 49

2. Total cats before the sale: 15 (Siamese) + 49 (House) = 64 cats

3. During the sale, they sold 19 cats.

4. To find out how many cats are left after the sale, we need to subtract the number sold (19 cats) from the initial total (64 cats):

64 total cats - 19 sold cats = 45 cats left in the pet store.

Therefore, after selling 19 cats, the pet store has 45 cats left.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the waiter had 39 customers, and then he added 12 more customers. So, the total number of customers the waiter had to serve was:

39 customers + 12 customers = 51 customers

Now, we know that 49 out of the total 51 customers did not leave a tip. So, to find out how many customers did leave a tip, we can subtract the number of customers who did not leave a tip from the total number of customers:

Total customers - Customers who didn't leave a tip = Customers who left a tip
51 customers - 49 customers = 2 customers

So, 2 customers left a tip for the waiter.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
We can start by listing out the initial quantities and changes:

Initial customers: 39
Additional customers: 12
Total customers: 39 + 12 = 51

Customers who did not leave a tip: 49

To calculate the number of customers who did leave a tip, we subtract the customers who did not leave a tip from the total customers:

Customers who left a tip = Total customers - Customers who did not leave a tip
Customers who left a tip = 51 - 49
Customers who left a tip = 2

So, 2 customers left a tip.

Q: Ned was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 50 games from a friend and bought 27 more at a garage sale. If 74 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ned bought 50 games from a friend.
2. Ned bought 27 more games at a garage sale.
Total number of games acquired = 50 + 27 = 77 games.

However, if 74 games didn't work, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many good games Ned ended up with:

Good games = Total games acquired - Games that didn't work
Good games = 77 - 74
Good games = 3 games

Therefore, Ned ended up with 3 good games from the collection he acquired.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3

Q: In fourth grade there were 33 students at the start of the year. During the year 18 students left and 14 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Start of the year: 
   Initially, there were 33 students.

2. During the year:
   - 18 students left, or were moved out.
   - 14 new students joined the school, or were brought in.
   
3. Calculation:
   To find the total number of students at the end of the year, we can:
   - Subtract the students who left (18) from the initial count of students (33).
   - Add the new students that came in (14).
   
Here's the calculation:
33 (initial students) - 18 (students who left) + 14 (new students) = Total number of students at the end of the year.

Let's calculate to find the final number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 33 students at the start of the year.
During the year, 18 students left. This means 18 students were taken away from the initial total.
So, we can calculate the number of students left after some left as:
33 (initial students) - 18 (students who left) = 15 students remaining.

Next, 14 new students came to school.
We add the 14 new students to the students remaining after some left:
15 (students remaining) + 14 (new students) = 29 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Therefore, there were 29 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Certainly! To determine the total number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we can start with the initial number of students and then account for the students who left and the new students who arrived.

Initially, there were 33 students at the start of the year.
18 students left during the year, so we need to subtract this number from the initial count: 33 - 18 = 15
Then, 14 new students came to school during the year. We add this number to the remaining students: 15 + 14 = 29

Therefore, at the end of the year, there were 29 students in fourth grade.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 29.

Q: In fourth grade there were 40 students at the start of the year. During the year 14 students left and 26 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Let's start by calculating the total number of students at the end of the year in fourth grade:

Number of students at the start of the year = 40
Number of students who left during the year = 14
Number of new students who came during the year = 26

Total number of students at the end of the year = Number of students at the start + Number of new students - Number of students who left
Total number of students at the end of the year = 40 + 26 - 14
Total number of students at the end of the year = 66 - 14
Total number of students at the end of the year = 52

Therefore, at the end of the year, there were 52 students in fourth grade.

3. So, after the 14 students left, the remaining number of students was 40 - 14 = 26 students.
4. In addition, 26 new students joined the school.
5. Therefore, the final number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year would be 26 (remaining students) + 26 (new students) = 52 students.

So, there were 52 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 52

Q: Wendy was playing a video game and had 43 lives. In a hard part of the game she lost 8 lives. If she got 39 more lives in the next level, how many lives would she have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, Wendy had 43 lives. She lost 8 lives, which means 8 lives were consumed. So, she would have 43 - 8 = 35 lives left.

When she gains 39 more lives in the next level, we need to add this to the number of lives she has left. 

Therefore, Wendy would have 35 + 39 = 74 lives after gaining 39 more lives in the next level.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 74

Q: At the arcade Cody won 49 tickets. If he spent 25 tickets on a beanie and later won 6 more tickets, how many would he have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Step 1: Initially won tickets = 49
Step 2: Tickets spent on beanie = 25
Step 3: Tickets won later = 6

To find the total tickets Cody would have after he spent 25 tickets on a beanie and then won 6 more tickets, we need to calculate the following:

Total tickets remaining = Initial tickets won - Tickets spent on beanie + Tickets won later

Total tickets remaining = 49 - 25 + 6
Total tickets remaining = 24 + 6
Total tickets remaining = 30

Therefore, Cody would have 30 tickets after spending 25 tickets on a beanie and then winning 6 more tickets at the arcade.

Q: For Halloween Haley scored 33 pieces of candy. She ate 17 pieces the first night and then her sister gave her 19 more pieces. How many pieces of candy does Haley have now?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Haley received 33 pieces of candy.
2. Haley then ate 17 pieces on the first night, which means she consumed 17 pieces.
3. After consuming 17 pieces, she received 19 more pieces from her sister.
4. Therefore, to find out how many pieces of candy Haley has now, we need to calculate the total pieces after taking into account both the initial candy received and the candies she consumed and received afterwards.

So, to find out how many pieces of candy Haley has now, we can calculate it as follows:

Initial candies received: 33 pieces
Candies consumed on the first night: 17 pieces
Candies received from her sister: 19 pieces

Total candies remaining = Initial candies - Candies consumed + Candies received
Total candies remaining = 33 - 17 + 19
Total candies remaining = 33 - 17 + 19
Total candies remaining = 16 + 19
Total candies remaining = 35

Therefore, Haley now has 35 pieces of candy.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
To start, the teacher initially had 34 worksheets to grade. She graded 7 of them, so the number of worksheets left to grade after grading the 7 is:

34 - 7 = 27

Next, another 36 worksheets were turned in. To find the total number of worksheets the teacher now has to grade, we add the number of worksheets left to grade with the newly turned in worksheets:

27 + 36 = 63

Therefore, the teacher would have 63 worksheets to grade in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 63

Q: At the fair there were 7 people in line for the bumper cars. If 4 of them got tired of waiting and left and 8 more got in line, how many people would be in line?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there were 7 people in line for the bumper cars.
2. 4 people got tired of waiting and left the line. This means 4 people were removed from the line.
3. After the 4 people left, 8 more people got in line. This means an additional 8 people joined the line.

So, to determine how many people would be in line after 4 people left and 8 more joined, we can calculate it as follows:

Initial number of people in line: 7
People who left: -4
People who joined: +8

Total number of people in line = 7 - 4 + 8 = 11

Therefore, after 4 people left and 8 more people joined, there would be 11 people in line for the bumper cars.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 11

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, there were 7 people in line for the bumper cars. 
4 of them got tired of waiting and left, so 4 people were removed from the line.
After that, 8 more people got in line. 

Therefore, to find the final count of people in line:
7 (initially) - 4 (left) + 8 (joined) = ?
Can you calculate the final count of people in line with these examples?

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7 - 4 + 8 =
7 - 4 is 3
3 + 8 is 11

Thus, there would be 11 people in line for the bumper cars after 4 left and 8 more got in line.

Q: Janet was playing a video game and had 38 lives. In a hard part of the game she lost 16 lives. If she got 32 more lives in the next level, how many lives would she have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, we can break it down step by step:

1. Janet had 38 lives initially.
2. She lost 16 lives during a hard part of the game.
3. To find out how many lives she has left after losing 16, we subtract 16 from 38:
   38 - 16 = 22 lives remaining.
4. In the next level, Janet gained 32 more lives.
5. To find out her total lives after gaining 32, we add the 32 lives to the 22 remaining lives:
   22 + 32 = 54 lives.

So, Janet would have 54 lives in total after gaining 32 more lives in the next level.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Initially, the store had 50 oranges in the bin.
Step 2: They threw away 40 of the old oranges, which means 50 - 40 = 10 old oranges remaining in the bin.
Step 3: They put 24 new oranges in the bin, so adding the new ones to the old ones, we get 10 (old) + 24 (new) = 34 oranges in the bin.

Therefore, there would be 34 oranges in the bin after they threw away 40 old ones and put in 24 new ones.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 34

Q: Oliver had 11 socks. If he threw away 4 old ones that didn't fit and bought 26 new ones, how many socks would he have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Oliver initially had 11 socks.
2. He threw away 4 old socks.
3. He bought 26 new socks.

So, to find out how many socks Oliver would have in the end, we need to calculate the total sock count:
11 (initial socks) - 4 (old socks thrown away) + 26 (new socks bought) = Total number of socks

Let's compute that:
11 - 4 + 26 = 33

Therefore, Oliver would have 33 socks in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 33

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Let's start with the items Billy consumed: 
- He rode the ferris wheel 7 times, so that would be 7 rides
- He rode the bumper cars 3 times, so that would be 3 rides

Next, let's calculate the total number of rides Billy took:
7 rides (ferris wheel) + 3 rides (bumper cars) = 10 rides

Since each ride cost 5 tickets, we can calculate the total number of tickets Billy used:
10 rides * 5 tickets per ride = 50 tickets

Therefore, Billy used 50 tickets in total for all his rides at the carnival.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 50

Certainly! Let's break it down:

Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times, so he used 7 rides x 5 tickets/ride = 35 tickets on the ferris wheel.

Billy rode the bumper cars 3 times, so he used 3 rides x 5 tickets/ride = 15 tickets on the bumper cars.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times, and each ride cost 5 tickets. So, 7 rides on the ferris wheel would be 7 x 5 = 35 tickets.
2. Billy also rode the bumper cars 3 times, and each ride cost 5 tickets. So, 3 rides on the bumper cars would be 3 x 5 = 15 tickets.

To find out how many tickets Billy used in total, we just need to sum up the tickets used for both rides:

Total tickets used = Tickets for ferris wheel + Tickets for bumper cars
Total tickets used = 35 tickets + 15 tickets
Total tickets used = 50 tickets

Therefore, Billy used 50 tickets in total for riding the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times at the town carnival.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 50.

Q: Victor was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 6 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 5 hours and on Tuesday he worked 5 hours. How much money did Victor make in those two days?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
I believe you may have mixed up your questions. The scenario you provided is about Victor's earnings at a grocery store, not about the quantity of items acquired, consumed, or discarded. Let's focus on calculating Victor's total earnings for those two days he worked:

Victor earned $6 per hour and worked 5 hours on Monday, so he made 6 * 5 = $30 on Monday.
He worked another 5 hours on Tuesday, so he made an additional 6 * 5 = $30 on Tuesday.
Therefore, in those two days combined, Victor made a total of $30 + $30 = $60.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $60

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
I'm sorry, but I'm a little confused by your question. It seems like you may be talking about two different scenarios - one about Victor's earnings at the grocery store and another about items being acquired and consumed. Could you please provide clarification or let me know which scenario you would like me to help you with?

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Victor made $60 in those two days. (6 dollars/hour x 5 hours/day x 2 days = $60)

Q: Victor was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 6 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 5 hours and on Tuesday he worked 5 hours. How much money did Victor make in those two days?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
It seems like you might be asking a different question related to items acquired and discarded, rather than about Victor's work hours and earnings. Could you please clarify if you have a specific question about item quantities, or would you like to focus on Victor's earnings calculation instead?

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Victor worked a total of 10 hours over the two days, Monday and Tuesday. At a rate of $6 per hour, the total amount that Victor made in those two days would be 10 hours x $6/hour = $60. So, Victor made $60 in those two days.

Q: Katie was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 4 bead necklaces and 3 gem stone necklaces. If each necklace cost 3 dollars, how much money did she earn?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, Katie had 4 bead necklaces and 3 gemstone necklaces to sell. She sold all of them, so none remained. 

For the bead necklaces:
Initial quantity = 4
Sold = 4

For the gemstone necklaces:
Initial quantity = 3
Sold = 3

So, the final quantity remaining for both types of necklaces is 0. 

Since each necklace was sold for $3, we can calculate the total money earned by multiplying the cost per necklace by the total quantity sold. 

Total money earned = (4 bead necklaces sold × $3) + (3 gemstone necklaces sold × $3)
Total money earned = ($12) + ($9)
Total money earned = $21

Therefore, Katie earned $21 by selling all of her necklaces at the garage sale.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Great question! To find Amy's score, we can first calculate the number of points she gets for each level, and then sum up the total score. 

On the first level, Amy found 6 treasures and scored 4 points for each treasure. So, her score for the first level would be: 

6 treasures * 4 points = 24 points 

On the second level, Amy found 2 treasures, and again, each treasure is worth 4 points. So, her score for the second level would be: 

2 treasures * 4 points = 8 points 

To find her total score, we add the scores from both levels together:

24 points (first level) + 8 points (second level) = 32 points 

Therefore, Amy's total score for finding treasures in both levels would be 32 points.

1. Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy, each with 4 pieces, so he initially had 2 boxes * 4 pieces per box = 8 pieces of chocolate candy.

2. Similarly, he bought 5 boxes of caramel candy, each with 4 pieces, so he initially had 5 boxes * 4 pieces per box = 20 pieces of caramel candy.

3. To find the total amount of candy Adam had, we add the quantities of chocolate and caramel candy: 8 pieces of chocolate + 20 pieces of caramel = 28 pieces of candy in total.

Therefore, Adam had a total of 28 pieces of candy.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 28

Q: Roger was putting his spare change into piles. He had 3 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. If each pile had 7 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Roger initially had 3 piles of quarters, with 7 quarters in each pile, for a total of 3 * 7 = 21 quarters.
He also had 3 piles of dimes, with 7 dimes in each pile, for a total of 3 * 7 = 21 dimes.

To find out the total number of coins he had, we need to add the number of quarters and dimes together:
Total number of coins = 21 quarters + 21 dimes = 42 coins

Therefore, Roger had a total of 42 coins in his piles.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42.

Q: Roger was putting his spare change into piles. He had 3 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. If each pile had 7 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Roger had 3 piles of quarters with 7 coins each, so 3 * 7 = 21 quarters.
This means he had 21 quarters = 21 * 25 cents = 525 cents from quarters.
Similarly, Roger had 3 piles of dimes with 7 coins each, so 3 * 7 = 21 dimes.
This means he had 21 dimes = 21 * 10 cents = 210 cents from dimes.
Therefore, Roger had a total of 525 cents from quarters + 210 cents from dimes = 735 cents in total.
Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, Roger had 735 cents / 100 = 7 dollars and 35 cents in total.
So, Roger had a total of 21 quarters + 21 dimes = 42 coins in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Roger had 3 piles of quarters, with 7 quarters in each pile. So, the number of quarters he had initially is: 3 piles x 7 quarters/pile = 21 quarters.

Similarly, he also had 3 piles of dimes, with 7 dimes in each pile. So, the number of dimes he had initially is: 3 piles x 7 dimes/pile = 21 dimes.

To find the total number of coins he had, we need to calculate the sum of quarters and dimes: 21 quarters + 21 dimes = 42 coins in total.

Therefore, Roger had a total of 42 coins (quartes and dimes combined) in his piles.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42

Q: Luke made 9 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Luke initially had a total of $9 + $18 = $27. If he spent $3 a week, we can calculate how many weeks the money would last by dividing the total amount of money he had by the amount he spends each week.

Total money = $27
Amount spent each week = $3

Number of weeks money will last = Total money / Amount spent each week
Number of weeks money will last = $27 / $3 = 9 weeks

Therefore, Luke's money would last him for 9 weeks.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9 weeks.

Q: Luke made 9 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Luke initially earned a total of 9 dollars + 18 dollars = 27 dollars.
He spent 3 dollars each week, so he would spend 3 dollars x number of weeks.
To determine how long the money would last him, we need to divide the total amount of money he earned initially by the amount he spends each week. 

So, the remaining money = 27 dollars / 3 dollars = 9 weeks. 

Therefore, the money would last Luke for 9 weeks.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! To determine how many problems Nancy has left after completing 17 math problems and 15 spelling problems, we need to subtract those amounts from the total number of problems she initially had. Subtracting 17 math problems and 15 spelling problems from the total will give us the number of problems she has left to complete.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 17 + 15 = 32 problems were initially acquired by Nancy. 32 - 17 - 15 = 0 problems remaining to solve.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Step 1: Initially, Will had 8 new cards and 10 old cards, which is a total of 18 cards.

Step 2: Will organizes the cards in a binder with 3 on each page. So, to find out how many pages he would need, we divide the total number of cards by 3.

18 cards / 3 cards per page = 6 pages

Therefore, Will would use 6 pages to organize his baseball cards in the binder.

Q: Will was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 8 new cards and 10 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Will starts with some cards in the binder.
2. He has 8 new cards to add.
3. He also has 10 old cards to add.
4. Each page in the binder holds 3 cards.
5. We'll need to calculate the total number of cards that Will has to organize.
6. Once we have the total number of cards, we can divide by 3 to find out how many pages Will will need.

Let's calculate the total number of cards first.

Total number of cards = Initial cards + New cards + Old cards
Total number of cards = Initial cards + 8 + 10

Once we have the total number of cards, we can divide by 3 to find out how many pages Will will use in his binder.

Let's calculate the total number of cards for Will to organize.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Total number of cards = Initial cards + New cards + Old cards
Total number of cards = Initial cards + 8 + 10

If we denote the number of initial cards as "x," the total number of cards can be represented as x + 8 + 10.

Given that each page in the binder holds 3 cards, the number of pages needed can be calculated by dividing the total number of cards by 3:

Number of pages = (x + 8 + 10) / 3

Since we know that each page already has 3 cards, we can say:

3n = x + 8 + 10
3n = x + 18
x = 3n - 18

Therefore, the number of pages needed is:
Number of pages = ((3n - 18) + 8 + 10) / 3

Simplify the expression to find the final answer in arabic numerals.

Q: Roger was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Let's break down the tray pickup process step by step:

1. Roger picks up 4 trays from the table with 10 trays initially. This leaves 10 - 4 = 6 trays on that table.
2. Roger picks up another 4 trays from the same table. This leaves 6 - 4 = 2 trays on that table.
3. Roger picks up the remaining 2 trays from the table, which clears that table. Now, all 10 trays have been picked up.
4. Roger then goes to the table with 2 trays and picks them up.

In total, Roger will make 3 trips to pick up all the trays.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3

Q: Roger was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, Roger had to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another, which is a total of 10 + 2 = 12 trays.

Since Roger can only carry 4 trays at a time, the number of trips he will make can be determined by dividing the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

12 trays / 4 trays per trip = 3 trips

Therefore, Roger will make 3 trips to pick up the 12 trays.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3

$24 - $3x = 0

Now, we can solve for x:
$24 - $3x = 0
$3x = $24
x = $24 / $3
x = 8

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Mike initially earned $14 mowing lawns and $26 weed-eating, for a total of $40. Since he spent $5, we subtract that amount from the total to find out how much money he has left: $40 - $5 = $35. This remaining money will last him until $35 is spent again. To determine how many weeks this money will last, we need to divide the total remaining money by his weekly spending: $35 / $5 = 7 weeks. So, the money will last him 7 weeks.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, Mike had a total of $40 ($14 from mowing lawns + $26 from weed eating). If he spent $5 per week, we can calculate how long the money would last him.

First, we need to determine how much money he spends each week. Since he spends $5 per week, we can divide the total amount of money he had initially by the amount he spends per week:
$40 / $5 = 8 weeks

Thus, if Mike spends $5 per week, the $40 he earned would last him 8 weeks.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8 weeks.

Now, we subtract the weekly spending from the total earnings to find out how much money he has left each week: 
40 dollars - 5 dollars = 35 dollars.

Since he spends 5 dollars each week, we divide the remaining earnings by the weekly spending to determine how many weeks the money will last: 
35 dollars ÷ 5 dollars = 7 weeks. 

So, the money will last Mike for 7 weeks.

First, let's add up the total amount of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends:

Gwen recycled 5 pounds.
Her friends recycled 13 pounds.
Total pounds recycled = 5 + 13 = 18 pounds

Now, let's determine how many points they earned based on the recycling program's rule - for every 3 pounds, they earn one point:

Number of 3-pound intervals in total pounds recycled = 18 / 3 = 6 intervals

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned 6 points in total for recycling 18 pounds of paper.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6

Let's start by determining the total weight of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends. Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds, so the total weight of paper recycled is 5 + 13 = 18 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how many points they earned based on the amount of paper recycled. For every 3 pounds recycled, they earned 1 point. To find out how many points they earned for 18 pounds of recycled paper, we can divide 18 by 3:

18 pounds ÷ 3 pounds = 6 points

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned a total of 6 points for recycling 18 pounds of paper.

To determine the total points earned from recycling, we first need to calculate the total pounds of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends. 

Gwen recycled 5 pounds of paper.
Her friends recycled 13 pounds of paper.

Therefore, the total pounds of paper recycled is:
5 pounds + 13 pounds = 18 pounds

Now, we need to determine how many points they earned for recycling 18 pounds of paper. 
Since they earn one point for every 3 pounds recycled, we can divide the total pounds (18) by 3 to find out how many points they earned:
18 pounds ÷ 3 = 6 points

Thus, Gwen and her friends earned a total of 6 points for recycling 18 pounds of paper.

Total initial candy: 11 + 5 = 16 pieces

Candy consumed per day: 8 pieces

To determine how long the candy will last, we need to find the total number of days it will take for Megan to consume all the candy:

Total candy received: 16 pieces
Candy consumed per day: 8 pieces

Total days to consume all candy = Total candy received / Candy consumed per day
Total days = 16 pieces / 8 pieces per day = 2 days

Therefore, the 16 pieces of candy will last Megan for 2 days if she eats 8 pieces a day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
To figure out how long the candy will last Megan, we first need to determine the total number of pieces of candy she received. Megan received 11 pieces of candy from her neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister, so she originally had 11 + 5 = 16 pieces of candy.

If Megan eats 8 pieces of candy each day, we can subtract 8 pieces for each day until there are no more pieces left.

First day: 16 - 8 = 8 pieces
Second day: 8 - 8 = 0 pieces (all the candy is gone)

So, the candy will last Megan for 2 days if she eats 8 pieces a day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

Q: Maria was making baggies of cookies with 5 cookies in each bag. If she had 33 chocolate chip cookies and 2 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! Maria had 33 chocolate chip cookies and 2 oatmeal cookies, so she had a total of 33 + 2 = 35 cookies initially. Since she was putting 5 cookies in each bag, we can calculate the number of baggies she could make by dividing the total number of cookies by 5. 

35 cookies / 5 cookies per bag = 7 baggies

Maria could make 7 baggies of cookies with the cookies she had.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria originally had 33 chocolate chip cookies.
2. She was making baggies with 5 cookies in each, so she made 33/5 = 6 bags of chocolate chip cookies.
3. The leftover chocolate chip cookies after making the bags would be 33 - 6*5 = 33 - 30 = 3 chocolate chip cookies.

Now let's look at the oatmeal cookies:

1. Maria had 2 oatmeal cookies.
2. She needs 5 cookies to make a bag, which means she couldn't make a bag of oatmeal cookies.

Therefore, Maria could make a total of 6 bags of chocolate chip cookies, but she didn't have enough oatmeal cookies to make a full bag.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6

Q: There school's baseball team had 4 new players and 6 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 5 players in each group, how many groups would there be?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! The school's baseball team initially had 4 new players and 6 returning players, totaling 10 players. If the coach put them into groups of 5 players each, we can calculate the number of groups by dividing the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

Total number of players = 4 new players + 6 returning players
Total number of players = 10 players

Number of players in each group = 5

Number of groups = Total number of players / Number of players in each group
Number of groups = 10 players / 5 players
Number of groups = 2 groups

Therefore, there would be a total of 2 groups if the coach puts the players into groups with 5 players in each group.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

Q: A pet shelter had 5 puppies when another 35 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the pet shelter had 5 puppies. Then, 35 more puppies were brought in, making a total of 5 + 35 = 40 puppies at the shelter.

If 8 puppies are adopted per day, it means that the shelter is reducing the number of puppies by 8 each day. To determine how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, divide the total number of puppies (40) by the number of puppies adopted per day (8):

40 puppies / 8 puppies/day = 5 days

So, it would take 5 days for all the puppies at the shelter to be adopted if 8 puppies are adopted each day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the pet shelter had 5 puppies. When 35 more puppies were brought in, the total number of puppies became 5 + 35 = 40 puppies.

Every day, 8 puppies are adopted. To find out how long it would take for all puppies to be adopted, we need to calculate the number of days it would take to adopt 40 puppies at a rate of 8 puppies per day.

So, to determine the total number of days needed to adopt all the puppies, we divide the total number of puppies (40) by the adoption rate per day (8):

40 puppies ÷ 8 puppies/day = 5 days.

Therefore, it would take 5 days for all the puppies to be adopted if 8 puppies are adopted per day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! We can break down the problem into steps:

1. Initially, there were 5 puppies in the shelter.
2. Another 35 puppies were brought in, making a total of 5 + 35 = 40 puppies.
3. Every day, 8 puppies are adopted. So, the number of puppies that will be adopted in x days is 8x.
4. The number of puppies remaining at the shelter after x days can be calculated as: 40 (total) - 8x (adopted) = 40 - 8x.

To find out how long it would take for all puppies to be adopted, we would set 40 - 8x = 0 (since we want all puppies to be adopted). Solve this equation for x to find out how many days it would take for all puppies to be adopted.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 40 - 8x = 0
8x = 40
x = 40 / 8
x = 5

It would take 5 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave picks up 17 trays from one table. After picking up these trays, there are 17 trays left on that table.
2. Dave can carry 9 trays at a time, so he will need to make 2 trips to pick up all 17 trays from the first table (17 trays ÷ 9 trays per trip = 1.88 trips, which rounds up to 2 trips).
3. After Dave has picked up all 17 trays from the first table, there are now 0 trays left on that table.
4. Dave then moves on to pick up 55 trays from the second table. After picking up these trays, there are 55 trays left on that table.
5. Dave will need to make 7 trips to pick up all 55 trays from the second table (55 trays ÷ 9 trays per trip = 6.11 trips, which rounds up to 7 trips).
6. After Dave has picked up all 55 trays from the second table, there are now 0 trays left on that table.

So, Dave will make a total of 2 trips to pick up the trays from the first table and 7 trips to pick up the trays from the second table, for a total of 2 + 7 = 9 trips.

Sarah received 66 pieces from neighbors + 15 pieces from her sister = 81 pieces in total.

Next, we need to calculate how many days' worth of candy she has.
If Sarah eats 9 pieces a day, then she consumes 9 pieces per day.
To find out how many days the candy will last, divide the total number of pieces Sarah received by the amount she eats per day: 81 pieces / 9 pieces per day = 9 days.

Therefore, the candy will last Sarah for 9 days.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

Q: Henry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's first calculate the total number of trays that Henry needs to pick up:
From the first table: 29 trays
From the second table: 52 trays

Total trays = 29 trays + 52 trays = 81 trays

Since Henry can only carry 9 trays at a time, we need to calculate how many trips he will need to make to pick up all 81 trays. We can start by dividing the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip:

81 trays / 9 trays per trip = 9 trips

Henry will need to make 9 trips to pick up all 81 trays.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

Q: Henry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Henry can only carry 9 trays at a time. He needs to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another table. 

First, let's calculate how many trips he needs to make for the 29 trays:

29 trays ÷ 9 trays per trip = 3 trips (with 2 trays left over)

So, he will make 3 trips to pick up the 29 trays.

Now, let's calculate how many trips he needs to make for the 52 trays:

52 trays ÷ 9 trays per trip ≈ 5 trips (with 7 trays left over)

So, he will make 5 trips to pick up the 52 trays.

In total, Henry will make 3 + 5 = 8 trips to pick up all the trays.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

Q: Henry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's start by adding up the number of trays that need to be picked up from each table:

From the first table: 29 trays
From the second table: 52 trays

Now, we can add these two amounts to find the total number of trays Henry needs to pick up:

29 trays + 52 trays = 81 trays

Since Henry can only carry 9 trays at a time, we need to find out how many trips he will need to make:

81 trays ÷ 9 trays per trip = 9 trips

Therefore, Henry will need to make 9 trips in total to pick up all the trays from both tables.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! Paul made a total of $68 + $13 = $81 from mowing lawns and weed eating.

He spent $9 every week, so to find out how long the money would last him, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the amount he spent weekly:

$81 ÷ $9 = 9

Therefore, the money would last Paul for 9 weeks in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

Q: Paul made 68 dollars mowing lawns and 13 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 9 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! To determine how long the money will last Paul, we need to first calculate his total initial earnings:

Total earnings = Mowing lawns + Weed eating
Total earnings = $68 + $13
Total earnings = $81

Next, we subtract his weekly expenses from his total earnings to find out how much money he would have left each week:

Money remaining per week = Total earnings - Weekly expenses
Money remaining per week = $81 - $9
Money remaining per week = $72

To find out how long the money will last Paul, we divide the remaining money each week into the total amount:

Number of weeks the money will last = Total remaining money / Weekly expenses
Number of weeks the money will last = $72 / $9
Number of weeks the money will last = 8 weeks

Therefore, the money will last Paul for 8 weeks if he spends $9 per week.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, let's calculate the total amount of money Paul earned:
Total earnings = 68 (mowing lawns) + 13 (weed eating) = 81 dollars

Then, let's deduct his weekly expenses from his total earnings:
Remaining money per week = Total earnings - Weekly expenses = 81 - 9 = 72 dollars

To determine how long the money will last, we divide the remaining money by the weekly expenses:
Number of weeks the money will last = Remaining money per week / Weekly expenses = 72 / 9 = 8 weeks

Therefore, with his earnings and expenses, the money will last Paul for 8 weeks.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, we need to determine the total number of bears the toy store had after the new shipment arrived. They initially had 6 bears in stock, and then received an additional 18 bears in the new shipment. 

Total bears = initial bears + new shipment bears
Total bears = 6 + 18
Total bears = 24

Since they put 6 bears on each shelf, we can calculate the number of shelves used by dividing the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf.

Number of shelves = Total bears / Bears per shelf
Number of shelves = 24 / 6
Number of shelves = 4

Therefore, the toy store used 4 shelves to display all the bears.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, there were 17 puppies in the pet shelter.
2. Another 55 puppies were brought in, so the total number of puppies in the shelter is now 17 + 55 = 72 puppies.
3. If 8 puppies are adopted each day, we need to calculate how many days it would take to adopt all 72 puppies.
4. The total number of puppies that need to be adopted is 72.
5. If 8 puppies are adopted each day, it will take 72 ÷ 8 = 9 days to adopt all the puppies in the shelter.

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies in the shelter to be adopted if 8 puppies are adopted each day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initial number of puppies = 17  
Puppies brought in = 55  
Total number of puppies = 17 + 55 = 72  

Puppies adopted per day = 8  

To determine how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to find out how many days it would take to adopt all 72 puppies at a rate of 8 puppies per day. Let's calculate:  

Remaining puppies = Total number of puppies - Puppies adopted each day  
Remaining puppies = 72 - 8 = 64  

Now, the number of days it would take to adopt all puppies:  
Number of days = Remaining puppies ÷ Puppies adopted per day  
Number of days = 64 ÷ 8 = 8  

Therefore, it would take 8 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8

Certainly! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the pet shelter had 17 puppies.
2. 55 more puppies were brought in, making the total number of puppies in the shelter 17 + 55 = 72 puppies.

To determine the number of days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to calculate how many days it would take to adopt all 72 puppies at a rate of 8 puppies per day:

1. Total number of puppies: 72
2. Adoption rate per day: 8 puppies

To determine the number of days required to adopt all the puppies, we divide the total number of puppies by the adoption rate per day:

72 puppies / 8 puppies per day = 9 days

Therefore, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted if 8 puppies are adopted per day.

Q: Haley and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, let's determine how many points Haley earned for recycling 11 pounds of paper. 

Since every 3 pounds of paper earns 1 point, we can divide 11 pounds by 3 to find out how many points Haley earned:
11 pounds / 3 pounds per point = 3 points and a remainder of 2 pounds

So, Haley earned 3 points for recycling 11 pounds of paper.

Next, let's determine how many points Haley's friends earned for recycling 16 pounds of paper. 

Following the same logic as before, we can divide 16 pounds by 3 to find out how many points Haley's friends earned:
16 pounds / 3 pounds per point = 5 points and a remainder of 1 pound

So, Haley's friends earned 5 points for recycling 16 pounds of paper.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of points earned by adding the points earned by Haley and her friends:
Total points earned = Points earned by Haley + Points earned by Haley's friends
Total points earned = 3 points + 5 points
Total points earned = 8 points

Therefore, Haley and her friends earned 8 points in total for recycling 11 pounds and 16 pounds of paper, respectively.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8

Q: Haley and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, Haley and her friends recycled a total of 11 + 16 = 27 pounds of paper. To determine how many points they earned, we need to calculate how many sets of 3 pounds they recycled to earn points.

For Haley, 11 pounds divided by 3 pounds per point equals 11 / 3 = 3.67 (approximately 3.67) sets of 3 pounds. Since they can only earn whole points, this means she earned 3 points.

For her friends, 16 pounds divided by 3 pounds per point equals 16 / 3 = 5.33 (approximately 5.33) sets of 3 pounds. Since they can only earn whole points, they earned 5 points.

So, in total, Haley and her friends earned 3 + 5 = 8 points by recycling paper.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8

To determine how many points Haley and her friends earned from recycling, we need to calculate the total pounds of paper they recycled.

Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, so together they recycled 11 + 16 = 27 pounds.

Next, we need to determine how many points they earned for recycling 27 pounds. For every 3 pounds recycled, they earned 1 point, so we divide the total pounds recycled by 3 to find out how many points they earned:

27 pounds / 3 = 9 points

Therefore, Haley and her friends earned a total of 9 points from recycling paper for their class.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the pet shelter had 17 puppies.
55 more puppies were brought in, making a total of 17 + 55 = 72 puppies in the shelter.

If 8 puppies are adopted every day:
First day: 72 puppies - 8 puppies = 64 puppies remaining
Second day: 64 puppies - 8 puppies = 56 puppies remaining
...
And so on, we can continue this pattern until all the puppies are adopted. Let's continue this calculation until we reach 0 remaining puppies to find out how many days it will take for all of them to be adopted.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Based on the given information, it will take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies, and then 55 more puppies were brought in. Therefore, the total number of puppies in the shelter is 17 + 55 = 72.

Each day, 8 puppies are adopted. To determine how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to calculate the number of days it would take to adopt 72 puppies at a rate of 8 puppies per day.

Dividing the total number of puppies (72) by the number of puppies adopted each day (8) gives us the number of days it would take to adopt all of them:

72 puppies ÷ 8 puppies/day = 9 days

Thus, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted if 8 puppies are adopted each day.

2. Additional puppies brought in = 19
Total number of puppies = 8 + 19 = 27

Now, let's calculate the number of puppies adopted per day:
3 puppies are adopted per day

To find out how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can use the following formula:

Total number of puppies / Number of puppies adopted per day = Number of days

27 puppies / 3 puppies per day = 9 days

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted if 3 puppies are adopted each day.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initial number of puppies = 8
Puppies brought in = 19
Total number of puppies = Initial + Brought in = 8 + 19 = 27

Puppies adopted per day = 3

To find out how many days it will take to adopt all the puppies, we need to calculate the remaining number of puppies after each day of adoptions until there are none left.

Remaining puppies after day 1 = 27 - 3 = 24
Remaining puppies after day 2 = 24 - 3 = 21
Remaining puppies after day 3 = 21 - 3 = 18
Remaining puppies after day 4 = 18 - 3 = 15
Remaining puppies after day 5 = 15 - 3 = 12
Remaining puppies after day 6 = 12 - 3 = 9
Remaining puppies after day 7 = 9 - 3 = 6
Remaining puppies after day 8 = 6 - 3 = 3

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

Initial math problems = 13
Initial spelling problems = 2
Total initial problems = 13 (math) + 2 (spelling) = 15 problems

Problems finished per hour = 3

To find out how long it will take Faye to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total time she will spend working on all the problems.

Q: Bianca and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Let's first calculate how many points Bianca earned by recycling 24 pounds of paper. Since every 3 pounds earns one point, we can divide 24 pounds by 3 pounds to find out how many points Bianca earned. 

24 pounds / 3 pounds = 8 points

So, Bianca earned 8 points from recycling 24 pounds of paper.

Now, we also need to calculate how many points her friends earned by recycling 3 pounds of paper. Since they recycled 3 pounds, they earned:

3 pounds / 3 pounds = 1 point

Therefore, Bianca and her friends earned a total of 8 points (Bianca's points) + 1 point (friends' points) = 9 points by recycling paper for their class.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

Q: There school's baseball team had 2 new players and 6 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 4 players in each group, how many groups would there be?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
To determine the number of groups needed, we first need to find the total number of players. In this case, we have 2 new players and 6 returning players, so the total number of players is 2 + 6 = 8 players.

Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 4 players we can create from the total number of players. 

Dividing the total number of players by the number of players in each group will give us the number of groups needed:
8 players / 4 players per group = 2 groups.

Therefore, there would be 2 groups needed to accommodate all the players.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the pet shelter had 3 puppies.
2. Then another 3 puppies were brought in, making the total number of puppies in the shelter 3 + 3 = 6 puppies.
3. Next, 3 puppies are adopted every day, which means the number of puppies being adopted is 3 each day.
4. To find out how many days it will take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day. 

So, total number of puppies = 6
Puppies adopted per day = 3

6 puppies / 3 puppies per day = 2 days

Therefore, it will take 2 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

Initially, the pet shelter had 3 puppies, and then another 3 puppies were brought in. So the total number of puppies is 3 + 3 = 6.

Each day, 3 puppies are adopted. To find out how long it will take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can calculate the number of days it takes to adopt all the puppies.

Initially, there are 6 puppies, and 3 are adopted each day. So the total number of days needed to adopt all puppies is 6 puppies / 3 puppies per day = 2 days. 

Therefore, it will take 2 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the shelter had 3 puppies and then 3 more were brought in, totaling 6 puppies. From the total of 6 puppies, 3 are adopted every day. To find the duration it takes for all the puppies to be adopted, we can divide the remaining puppies by the number adopted each day:

Remaining puppies = Total puppies - Total adopted
Remaining puppies = 6 - (3 x number of days)

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of days:
Remaining puppies = 0 (when all puppies are adopted)
6 - 3d = 0
3d = 6
d = 2 days

Therefore, it will take 2 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

Q: Vanessa and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 9 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Vanessa recycled 20 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, let's find out how many points Vanessa earned by recycling 20 pounds of paper. Since every 9 pounds recycled earns one point, we can use division to find how many groups of 9 pounds are in 20 pounds.

Dividing 20 by 9:
20 ÷ 9 = 2 with a remainder of 2

So, Vanessa earned 2 points by recycling 20 pounds of paper.

Now, let's find out how many points Vanessa's friends earned by recycling 16 pounds of paper. Using the same logic as above:

Dividing 16 by 9:
16 ÷ 9 = 1 with a remainder of 7

So, Vanessa's friends earned 1 point by recycling 16 pounds of paper.

Adding these points together:
Vanessa earned 2 points and her friends earned 1 point, totaling
2 + 1 = 3 points

Therefore, Vanessa and her friends earned a total of 3 points by recycling paper for their class.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
To determine the total points earned by Zoe and her friends, we first need to calculate the total pounds of paper recycled by Zoe and her friends. 

Zoe recycled 25 pounds and her friends recycled 23 pounds. So, the total pounds of paper recycled is 25 + 23 = 48 pounds.

Now, we know that for every 8 pounds of paper recycled, they earned one point. Therefore, to find out how many points they earned, we need to divide the total pounds recycled by 8 and then round down to the nearest whole number since they can only earn whole points.

48 pounds / 8 pounds per point = 6 points earned in total. 

Therefore, Zoe and her friends earned a total of 6 points by recycling paper for their class.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! 

Initially:
- 4 regular sodas
- 52 diet sodas

Total sodas = 4 (regular) + 52 (diet) = 56 sodas

If the fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf, we can calculate the number of shelves needed to hold all the sodas by dividing the total number of sodas by the amount that can fit on each shelf:
 
Number of shelves filled = Total sodas / Sodas per shelf
Number of shelves filled = 56 / 7 = 8 shelves

So, Tom would need 8 shelves to hold all the sodas he purchased.

Q: Victor was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 7 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 23 trays from one table and 5 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, Victor had to pick up 23 trays from one table and 5 trays from another table. This gives us a total of 23 + 5 = 28 trays in total.

Since Victor can only carry 7 trays at a time, he will need to make multiple trips to pick up all the trays. To determine the number of trips, we can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry per trip: 28 trays ÷ 7 trays per trip = 4 trips.

So, Victor will have to make 4 trips to pick up all 28 trays.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4 trips.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Of course! 

Emily received 5 pieces of candy from neighbors and 13 pieces from her older sister, totaling 5 + 13 = 18 pieces of candy initially acquired. 

If Emily ate 9 pieces of candy per day, then she would consume 9 pieces daily.

To find out how long the candy will last, we can calculate the remaining number of pieces after each day she eats the candy. This will help us determine the total number of days it will last her. 

Let's go through the calculation day by day:

Day 1: 
Initial candy = 18, consumed = 9, remaining = 18 - 9 = 9

Day 2:
Remaining from Day 1 = 9, consumed = 9, remaining = 9 - 9 = 0

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step to help solve the problem.

1. **Total Windows Needed**: 14 windows
2. **Windows Installed**: 5 windows
3. **Remaining Windows to be Installed**: Total Windows Needed - Windows Installed
   = 14 windows - 5 windows

So, the builder still needs to install 9 more windows.

Now, if it takes 4 hours to install each window, the total time to install 9 remaining windows would be:

9 windows * 4 hours/window = 36 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 36 hours to install the remaining windows.

Q: A chef needs to cook 16 potatoes. He has already cooked 7. If each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Number of potatoes originally acquired = 16 potatoes
2. Number of potatoes already cooked = 7 potatoes

Now, let's calculate the number of potatoes remaining to be cooked:

Remaining potatoes = Total potatoes - Cooked potatoes
Remaining potatoes = 16 - 7
Remaining potatoes = 9 potatoes

Since each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, the time required to cook the remaining 9 potatoes can be calculated by multiplying the number of potatoes by the time taken to cook each potato:

Time taken = Number of remaining potatoes * Time taken to cook each potato
Time taken = 9 potatoes * 5 minutes per potato
Time taken = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take the chef 45 minutes to cook the remaining 9 potatoes.

Q: Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Ned still have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy, so he initially had 14 boxes * 6 pieces per box = 84 pieces of chocolate candy.

Next, Ned gave 7 boxes to his little brother, which is 7 boxes * 6 pieces per box = 42 pieces.

If Ned gave away 42 pieces, he is left with 84 pieces - 42 pieces = 42 pieces of chocolate candy. 

Therefore, Ned still has 42 pieces of chocolate candy remaining.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42

Q: Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Ned still have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy.
2. Each box contains 6 pieces of chocolate candy, so in total, there are 14 * 6 = 84 pieces of chocolate candy bought.
3. Ned gave 7 boxes to his little brother, which means 7 * 6 = 42 pieces of chocolate candy were given away.
4. To find out how many pieces Ned still had, subtract the pieces given away from the total pieces bought:
   Total pieces bought - Pieces given away = Pieces Ned still had
   84 - 42 = 42

Therefore, Ned still had 42 pieces of chocolate candy after giving 7 boxes to his little brother.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy.
2. Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so 14 boxes have a total of 14 * 6 = 84 pieces.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces Ned gave to his little brother:

1. Ned gave 7 boxes to his little brother.
2. Each box contained 6 pieces, so 7 boxes have a total of 7 * 6 = 42 pieces.

To find out how many pieces Ned still had after giving 7 boxes to his little brother, we subtract the pieces given away from the total initially acquired:

Total pieces initially acquired = 84 pieces
Pieces given to his little brother = 42 pieces

Ned still had 84 pieces - 42 pieces = 42 pieces left.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42 pieces left.

Q: A painter needed to paint 10 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 8 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Start by determining the total number of rooms that need to be painted, which is 10 rooms. Next, subtract the rooms that have already been painted from the total number of rooms to find the number of rooms left to paint. 

Total rooms = 10
Rooms already painted = 8
Rooms left to paint = Total rooms - Rooms already painted = 10 - 8 = 2 rooms

Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, and there are 2 rooms left to paint, you can multiply the time it takes to paint each room by the number of rooms left to find the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms.

Time needed to paint remaining rooms = Time per room * Rooms left to paint = 8 hours/room * 2 rooms = 16 hours

Therefore, the painter will need an additional 16 hours to complete painting the remaining 2 rooms.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16 hours.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, Olivia had 7 chocolate bars in the box. She sold all but 4 bars. 
So, 7 - 4 = 3 bars remained unsold. 

To calculate how much money Olivia would have made, we need to multiply the number of bars sold by the cost per bar. Olivia sold 7 - 3 = 4 bars.
The total amount of money Olivia would have made is: 4 bars × $3 per bar = $12.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $12

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Olivia initially had a total of 7 chocolate bars in the box. She sold all but 4 bars, which means she sold 7 - 4 = 3 bars. So, Olivia sold 3 bars out of the 7 bars initially in the box.
To calculate how much money Olivia made, you can first find the total amount she would have made if she sold all the bars and then subtract the amount she didn't sell (4 bars).

Total sales of all 7 bars = 7 bars * $3/bar = $21
Total sales of 4 bars = 4 bars * $3/bar = $12
Therefore, Olivia would have made $21 - $12 = $9 if she sold all but 4 bars.

Sure! Let's break it down step by step:
1. There are 12 people in total in the group.
2. Out of the 12 people, 7 are kids and they eat for free.
3. So, the number of adult meals to be paid for is 12 - 7 = 5.
4. As each adult meal costs $3, the total cost for the group to eat would be 5 * $3 = $15.
Therefore, it would cost $15 for the group to eat, considering the given scenario.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Let's break it down step by step:

1. Total group size = 12
2. Number of kids in the group = 7
3. Number of adults in the group = Total group size - Number of kids = 12 - 7 = 5

Now, for the cost calculation:
- Each adult meal costs $3
- Kids eat free

Cost for adult meals = Number of adults x Cost per adult meal = 5 x $3 = $15
Cost for kids meals = 0 (as kids eat free)

Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat would be $15.

Q: Jerry had 7 action figures, but needed 16 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $8, how much money would he need to finish his collection?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially Jerry had 7 action figures and needed 16 for a complete collection, so to determine the final quantity remaining:

Total needed for a complete collection: 16
Initially acquired: 7
Remaining needed: 16 - 7 = 9

Jerry currently needs 9 more action figures to finish his collection. 

Let's calculate how much money he would need to finish his collection:
Cost per action figure: $8
Total cost for the remaining 9 action figures: 9 * $8 = $72

Jerry would need $72 to purchase the remaining 9 action figures and complete his collection.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $72

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, Jerry had 7 action figures, and he needed 16 total for a complete collection. 

To determine how many more action figures Jerry needs to complete his collection: 
16 (total needed) - 7 (initially had) = 9 more action figures needed.

Now, if each action figure costs $8, then multiply the number of action figures Jerry needs to buy with the cost of each:
9 (action figures needed) x $8 (cost per action figure) = $72.

Jerry would need $72 to finish his collection.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $72

Q: There were 16 friends playing a video game online when 7 players quit. If each player left had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, there were 16 friends playing the game and each had 8 lives, so the total number of lives at the start was 16 * 8 = 128 lives.

When 7 players quit, they took away 7 players * 8 lives each = 56 lives.

Therefore, the total remaining lives after 7 players quit would be 128 lives - 56 lives = 72 lives.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 72

Q: There were 16 friends playing a video game online when 7 players quit. If each player left had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, we need to determine the total number of lives initially before any players quit the game. Since there were 16 friends playing the game, and each player had 8 lives, the total number of lives at the beginning was 16 players × 8 lives/player = 128 lives.

Next, we need to find out how many lives were lost when 7 players quit. If each of those players had 8 lives, then the total number of lives lost would be 7 players × 8 lives/player = 56 lives.

To find the remaining total lives after the 7 players quit, we subtract the number of lives lost from the initial total: 128 initial lives - 56 lives lost = 72 lives remaining.

Therefore, after 7 players quit, there were 72 lives remaining.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step to determine the final quantity remaining:

1. Number of windows initially needed: 10
2. Number of windows already installed: 6

To find out how many windows still need to be installed, you can subtract the number of installed windows from the total number needed:
10 - 6 = 4

So, the builder still needs to install 4 windows. 

Since it takes 5 hours to install each window, the total time needed to install the remaining 4 windows can be calculated by multiplying the number of windows by the time needed to install each window:
4 windows * 5 hours/window = 20 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 20 hours to install the remaining 4 windows.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's start with the initial number of video games Mike had.

Initial number of video games = 16

Now, let's calculate the number of video games that weren't working.

Number of non-working video games = 8

To find the number of working video games Mike has left, we can subtract the number of non-working games from the initial number:

Number of working video games = 16 - 8 = 8

Now that we know Mike has 8 working video games, we can calculate how much money he could earn by selling them for $7 each:

Total earnings = Number of working games * Price per game
Total earnings = 8 * $7
Total earnings = $56

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, there were 8 players each having 5 lives. So, the total number of lives they had in the beginning was 8 players * 5 lives/player = 40 lives.

When 5 players quit, they took away their 5 lives each, so the total number of lives affected was 5 players * 5 lives/player = 25 lives.

To determine the total number of lives remaining after 5 players quit, we need to subtract the lives affected from the initial total:
40 total lives - 25 lives affected = 15 lives remaining.

Thus, the 8 friends had a total of 15 lives left after 5 players quit the game.

Sure! Initially, the trivia team had 15 members. However, 6 members did not show up for the game. To find out how many members did show up, we subtract the number of members who didn't show up from the total. 

Members who showed up = Total members - Members who didn't show up
Members who showed up = 15 - 6
Members who showed up = 9

Now that we know 9 members showed up for the game, and each member scored 3 points, we can find the total points scored by multiplying the number of members who showed up by the points per member.

Total points scored = Members who showed up * Points per member
Total points scored = 9 * 3
Total points scored = 27

Therefore, a total of 27 points were scored by the members who showed up for the game.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 27

Q: Ned had 15 video games but 6 of them weren't working. If he wanted to sell the working games for $7 each, how much money could he earn?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! 

Initial quantity of video games Ned had = 15
Video games not working = 6

Number of working video games = Initial quantity - Video games not working
Number of working video games = 15 - 6
Number of working video games = 9

Therefore, Ned had 9 working video games that he could sell for $7 each. To calculate the total amount of money he could earn by selling all the working games:
Total amount = Number of working games * Price per game
Total amount = 9 * $7
Total amount = $63

So, Ned could earn $63 by selling all 9 working video games.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $63

Q: Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. If each box has 3 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Dave still have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy.
2. The total number of pieces in the 12 boxes is 12 boxes * 3 pieces per box = 36 pieces.
3. Dave gave 5 boxes to his little brother, so the number of pieces Dave gave away is 5 boxes * 3 pieces per box = 15 pieces.
4. Subtracting the pieces given away from the initial total, we have 36 pieces - 15 pieces = 21 pieces.
5. Therefore, Dave still has 21 pieces of chocolate candy left.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 21

Q: Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. If each box has 3 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Dave still have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! First, let's determine the total number of chocolate pieces Dave bought. He bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy, and each box has 3 pieces inside it. So, the total number of pieces he bought is 12 boxes * 3 pieces = 36 pieces.

Next, let's calculate the number of pieces Dave gave to his brother. He gave his little brother 5 boxes of chocolate candy, and each box has 3 pieces inside it. So, the total number of pieces he gave to his brother is 5 boxes * 3 pieces = 15 pieces.

Now, to find out how many pieces Dave still has, we subtract the pieces he gave to his brother from the total number of pieces he bought: 36 pieces - 15 pieces = 21 pieces.

Therefore, Dave still has 21 pieces of chocolate candy left after giving 5 boxes to his little brother.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 21

Q: Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. If each box has 3 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Dave still have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy, with each box containing 3 pieces, which gives him a total of 12 * 3 = 36 pieces of chocolate candy initially. 

He then gave 5 boxes to his little brother, which is equal to 5 * 3 = 15 pieces. 

Therefore, after giving away 5 boxes, Dave had 36 - 15 = 21 pieces of chocolate candy left.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 21

Q: John had 5 action figures, but needed 7 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $5, how much money would he need to finish his collection?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, I can help with that. 
John initially had 5 action figures, and he needed a total of 7 for a complete collection. So, to figure out how many more action figures he needs, we can subtract the initial quantity from the total needed. This would be: 7 - 5 = 2. 

Therefore, John needs 2 more action figures to complete his collection. To find out how much money he would need, we can multiply the cost of each action figure ($5) by the number of additional action figures needed (2): 
2 * $5 = $10.

So, John would need $10 to finish his collection.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $10

Q: A painter needed to paint 9 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the painter needed to paint 9 rooms in total. If he already painted 5 rooms, then the number of rooms left to be painted would be:

9 rooms - 5 rooms = 4 rooms

So, the painter still needs to paint 4 more rooms. Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms would be:

4 rooms * 8 hours per room = 32 hours

Therefore, the painter would need an additional 32 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The painter needed to paint 9 rooms in total.
2. Each room takes 8 hours to paint.
3. The painter has already painted 5 rooms.

To find out how many rooms are left to paint:

Total rooms needed to paint = 9
Rooms already painted = 5

Rooms left to paint = Total rooms - Rooms already painted
Rooms left to paint = 9 - 5
Rooms left to paint = 4

Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the painter will take:

Time to paint remaining rooms = Rooms left to paint * Time per room
Time to paint remaining rooms = 4 * 8
Time to paint remaining rooms = 32 hours

Therefore, the painter will take 32 hours longer to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32

Q: A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 8 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, there were a total of 14 windows needed for the building. The builder had already installed 8 windows, so the number of windows remaining to be installed is:

14 - 8 = 6 windows

Therefore, the builder still needs to install 6 windows. Given that it takes 8 hours to install each window, the total time needed to install the remaining windows can be calculated by multiplying the remaining number of windows by the time needed to install each window:

6 windows * 8 hours/window = 48 hours

Thus, it will take the builder 48 hours to install the rest of the windows.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is The answer is 48 hours.

Q: Bianca earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 17 bags, but didn't recycle 8 of them, how many points would she have earned?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! First, let's calculate the total points Bianca would have earned if she recycled all 17 bags:

Total bags recycled = 17 bags

Points earned per bag = 5 points

Total points if all bags were recycled = 17 bags * 5 points per bag = 85 points

Now, we need to consider that she didn't recycle 8 bags out of the total 17 bags:

Bags not recycled = 8 bags

Remaining bags recycled = Total bags - Bags not recycled = 17 bags - 8 bags = 9 bags

Now, let's calculate the total points Bianca would have earned from the 9 bags she recycled:

Total points earned from remaining bags = 9 bags * 5 points per bag = 45 points

Therefore, Bianca would have earned 45 points if she only recycled 9 out of the 17 bags.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Bianca had 17 bags in total, and she didn't recycle 8 of them. This means she did recycle 17 - 8 = 9 bags.

Since Bianca earned 5 points for each bag she recycled, the total points she earned is: 
9 bags * 5 points/bag = 45 points

Therefore, Bianca would have earned 45 points if she recycled 9 bags out of the 17 total bags.

Q: Bianca earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 17 bags, but didn't recycle 8 of them, how many points would she have earned?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! To determine the total number of bags Bianca recycled, we subtract the bags she didn't recycle from the total number of bags she had. 

Total bags = 17 bags
Bags not recycled = 8 bags

Bags recycled = Total bags - Bags not recycled
Bags recycled = 17 bags - 8 bags
Bags recycled = 9 bags

Since Bianca earned 5 points for each bag she recycled, we can calculate the total points she earned by multiplying the number of bags she recycled by 5.

Points earned = Bags recycled * Points per bag
Points earned = 9 bags * 5 points per bag
Points earned = 45 points

Q: A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes. He has already cooked 6. If each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the chef had 15 potatoes, and he cooked 6 of them. So, the remaining number of potatoes to be cooked is 15 - 6 = 9 potatoes. In total, he needs to cook 9 potatoes.

Since each potato takes 8 minutes to cook, the chef will need to spend 8 minutes per potato to cook the remaining 9 potatoes. Therefore, the total time required to cook the rest of the potatoes will be 8 minutes per potato * 9 potatoes = 72 minutes.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 72

Q: Henry had 3 action figures, but needed 8 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $6, how much money would he need to finish his collection?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Henry initially had 3 action figures, and he needed 8 total for a complete collection. This means he needed 8 - 3 = 5 more action figures to complete his collection. 
Since each action figure costs $6, Henry would need to spend 5 x $6 = $30 to finish his collection.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $30.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Henry initially had 3 action figures.
2. He needed 8 total for a complete collection.
3. To calculate how many action figures he still needs to complete his collection, we subtract the number he already had from the total he needed:
   Total needed - Total initially had = Total still needed
   8 - 3 = 5
4. So, Henry still needs 5 action figures to complete his collection.
5. Since each action figure costs $6, to find out how much money Henry would need to finish his collection, we multiply the cost per action figure by the number of action figures he still needs:
   Cost per action figure x Total still needed
   $6 x 5 = $30
6. Therefore, Henry would need $30 to finish his collection.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $30

Q: There were 10 friends playing a video game online when 7 players quit. If each player left had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 10 friends playing the video game. Each friend had 8 lives.
Therefore, the total number of lives that the 10 friends had initially was 10 friends * 8 lives = 80 lives.

Then, 7 players quit the game.
If each player who quit had 8 lives, then the total number of lives lost would be 7 players * 8 lives = 56 lives.

To find out how many lives were remaining after the 7 players quit, you subtract the lives lost from the total initial lives:
80 lives - 56 lives = 24 lives.

Therefore, after 7 players quit, there were 24 lives remaining in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 24

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! Initially, there were 10 friends with 8 lives each, so the total number of lives available would be 10 friends x 8 lives = 80 lives. 
When 7 players quit, they took with them 7 players x 8 lives = 56 lives. 
So, the remaining lives after 7 players quit would be the initial total lives minus the lives taken by those who quit, which is 80 lives - 56 lives = 24 lives. 
Therefore, after 7 players quit, there were a total of 24 lives remaining.

Q: A painter needed to paint 11 rooms in a building. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially acquired:
Rooms to paint = 11
Rooms painted = 2

Remaining rooms to be painted = Rooms to paint - Rooms painted
Remaining rooms to be painted = 11 - 2
Remaining rooms to be painted = 9

Time taken to paint each room = 7 hours

Total time needed to paint the remaining rooms = Remaining rooms * Time taken to paint each room
Total time needed = 9 rooms * 7 hours
Total time needed = 63 hours

Therefore, the painter will take 63 hours to paint the remaining rooms.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 63

Initial number of rooms to paint = 11
Rooms already painted = 2
Rooms left to paint = 11 - 2 = 9

Since each room takes 7 hours to paint, the painter will take 7 hours to paint each remaining room. To find out how much longer he will take to paint the rest, we need to calculate the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms:

Total time needed to paint the remaining rooms = 9 rooms * 7 hours/room = 63 hours

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 63 hours to paint the remaining 9 rooms.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step. 

Dave initially had 10 video games, but 2 of them weren't working. So he had 10 - 2 = 8 working video games left. 

If Dave sells the working games for $4 each, he could earn $4 x 8 = $32. 

Therefore, Dave could earn $32 by selling the working video games.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $32

Q: Dave had 10 video games but 2 of them weren't working. If he wanted to sell the working games for $4 each, how much money could he earn?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave had 10 video games in total.
2. 2 of the video games were not working, so Dave could not sell these.
3. Subtracting the non-working games from the total gives us the number of working games: 10 - 2 = 8.

Therefore, Dave had 8 working video games that he could sell for $4 each. To calculate how much he could earn, simply multiply the number of games by the selling price per game: 8 games * $4 per game = $32.

So, Dave could earn $32 by selling his 8 working video games.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $32.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the teacher had 4 problems on each worksheet, and there were 16 worksheets in total, so the total number of problems to grade would be 4 problems per worksheet * 16 worksheets = 64 problems in total.

If the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, we can find out how many more problems she has to grade by calculating the number of problems in those 8 worksheets:

Number of problems in graded worksheets = 4 problems per worksheet * 8 worksheets = 32 problems graded

The remaining number of problems to grade would be the total number of problems minus the problems already graded:

Remaining problems to grade = Total problems - Problems graded
Remaining problems to grade = 64 problems - 32 problems
Remaining problems to grade = 32 problems

Therefore, the teacher has 32 more problems to grade.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32

Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The teacher had 16 worksheets to grade in total.
2. Each worksheet had 4 problems on it, so the total number of problems initially was 16 worksheets * 4 problems per worksheet = 64 problems.
3. The teacher had already graded 8 worksheets, so she had graded 8 worksheets * 4 problems per worksheet = 32 problems.
4. Subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems to find out how many more problems she has left to grade: 64 total problems - 32 problems already graded = 32 more problems to grade.

Therefore, the teacher has 32 more problems to grade.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the teacher had 2 problems on each worksheet and there were 14 worksheets in total, so the teacher had 2 x 14 = 28 problems in total to grade. If the teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, then she has graded 7 x 2 = 14 problems. Therefore, the teacher still has 28 total problems - 14 problems already graded = 14 more problems to grade.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the teacher had 2 problems on each worksheet, and had a total of 14 worksheets to grade. So, the total number of problems to grade was 2 problems per worksheet x 14 worksheets = 28 problems.
The teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, so the number of problems she has already graded is 2 problems per worksheet x 7 worksheets = 14 problems.
To find out how many problems she still needs to grade, we subtract the problems already graded from the total number of problems. So, 28 total problems - 14 problems already graded = 14 problems left to grade.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14

Q: A worksheet had 2 problems on it. If a teacher had 14 worksheets to grade and had already graded 7 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! We can start by determining the total number of problems on each worksheet. Since there were 2 problems on each worksheet and the teacher had 14 worksheets, we can calculate the total number of problems as:

Total number of problems = Number of problems per worksheet x Total number of worksheets
Total number of problems = 2 problems/worksheet x 14 worksheets
Total number of problems = 28 problems

Next, we can determine how many problems the teacher has already graded. Given that the teacher has already graded 7 worksheets, we can calculate the total number of problems graded as:

Total number of problems graded = Number of problems per worksheet x Number of worksheets graded
Total number of problems graded = 2 problems/worksheet x 7 worksheets
Total number of problems graded = 14 problems

To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we can subtract the total number of problems graded from the initial total number of problems:

Number of problems remaining = Total number of problems - Total number of problems graded
Number of problems remaining = 28 problems - 14 problems
Number of problems remaining = 14 problems

Therefore, the teacher still has 14 more problems to grade on the remaining worksheets.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, let's determine how many roses were sold by subtracting the number of roses April had left from the number she started with: 13 - 4 = 9 roses were sold.

Next, to calculate how much money April earned, we can multiply the number of roses sold by the price per rose: 9 roses * $4 = $36.

Therefore, April earned $36 from selling the roses during the sale.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $36

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, April started with 13 roses.
2. Each rose was being sold for 4 dollars.
3. At the end, she had 4 roses left.

To calculate how many roses were sold, we subtract the remaining roses from the initial amount:

13 (initial roses) - 4 (remaining roses) = 9 roses were sold.

Now, to determine how much money April earned from the roses she sold:

9 (roses sold) x 4 dollars = 36 dollars.

Therefore, April earned 36 dollars from selling 9 roses.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 36

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The group consists of 15 people, with 8 of them being kids and the remaining 7 being adults.

2. Since kids eat for free, we can focus on the cost of the adult meals. Each adult meal costs $5.

3. There are 7 adults in the group, so the total cost of their meals would be 7 x $5 = $35.

4. Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat would be $35.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $35

Q: At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially acquired items:
- 15 people in total

Consumed or discarded items:
- 8 kids had free meals

Remaining items:
- 15 - 8 = 7 adult meals

Let's calculate the cost for the group to eat:
- 7 adult meals * $5 per adult meal = $35

So, it would cost $35 for the group to eat at the restaurant.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $35

Q: At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Let's break it down step by step:
1. Total number of people in the group = 15
2. Number of kids in the group = 8
3. Number of adults in the group = Total - Kids = 15 - 8 = 7
4. Cost for the adult meals = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal = 7 * $5 = $35
5. Cost for the kids (since they eat free) = 0
6. Total cost for the group to eat = Cost for adult meals + Cost for kids = $35 + $0 = $35
Therefore, it would cost $35 for the group of 15 people to eat at the restaurant.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $35

Q: Zoe baked 5 brownies, but needed 11 total for her party. If she used 7 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

**Initial situation:**
- Zoe baked 5 brownies.
- She needed a total of 11 brownies for the party.

**Calculation:**
- Zoe's deficit: 11 brownies needed - 5 brownies baked = 6 brownies remaining required.

**Flour calculation:**
- If Zoe used 7 cups of flour for each brownie:
- 7 cups of flour x 6 brownies remaining = 42 cups of flour needed.

Therefore, Zoe still needs 42 cups of flour to make the remaining 6 brownies for her party.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42 cups

Q: Zoe baked 5 brownies, but needed 11 total for her party. If she used 7 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Initially:
- Zoe baked 5 brownies
- She needed 11 brownies in total

Consumed:
- Zoe used 7 cups of flour for each brownie that she baked

To find out how many cups of flour Zoe still needs, first we need to calculate how many more brownies she needs to reach a total of 11. Since she baked 5 brownies and needs 11 in total, she still needs 11 - 5 = 6 more brownies.

Then, to determine the total amount of flour needed for the additional 6 brownies, we can multiply the number of additional brownies (6) by the amount of flour needed per brownie (7 cups):

6 brownies * 7 cups = 42 cups of flour

Therefore, Zoe still needs 42 cups of flour to reach her total of 11 brownies for the party.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42

Q: A new building needed 12 windows. The builder had already installed 6 of them. If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Initially, the builder needed 12 windows in total, and 6 windows had already been installed. So, the remaining number of windows to be installed would be:

12 total windows - 6 windows installed = 6 windows remaining

Now, we need to figure out how long it will take to install these remaining 6 windows. If it takes the builder 4 hours to install each window, then the total time needed to install the remaining windows would be:

6 windows remaining * 4 hours per window = 24 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 24 hours to install the remaining 6 windows in the building.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 24

Sure! John has 6 action figures, and for a complete collection, he needs a total of 11 action figures. To find out how many more action figures he needs to reach a complete collection, we subtract the number he already has from the total number needed:

11 total action figures - 6 action figures John already has = 5 action figures needed to complete the collection.

Once we know that John needs 5 more action figures, and each action figure costs $6, we can calculate the total cost to finish his collection:

5 action figures * $6 per action figure = $30.

So, John would need $30 to finish his collection of action figures.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 30

Q: John had 6 action figures, but needed 11 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $6, how much money would he need to finish his collection?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, John had 6 action figures, and he needed 11 in total for a complete collection. The difference between what he had and what he needed is 11 - 6 = 5 action figures. To complete his collection, he would need to buy the remaining 5 action figures. 

Since each action figure costs $6, John would need to spend $6 * 5 = $30 to buy the remaining action figures and complete his collection.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $30.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Initially, there were 13 friends playing, with each having 6 lives, so the total lives at the beginning would be 13 x 6 = 78 lives.

When 8 players quit, each with 6 lives each, they took away 8 x 6 = 48 lives.

To find the total lives remaining, we subtract the lives taken away from the total at the beginning: 78 - 48 = 30 lives remaining.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, there were 13 friends playing the video game, and each player had 6 lives. 

So, the total number of lives initially:

13 players * 6 lives per player = 78 lives 

When 8 players quit, they took their lives with them:

8 players * 6 lives per player = 48 lives 

To find the total number of lives remaining after 8 players quit:

78 total lives - 48 lives taken = 30 lives remaining. 

Therefore, there were 30 lives remaining after 8 players quit.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, there were 13 friends playing the video game, and each player had 6 lives. So the total number of lives that were initially in the game was 13 friends x 6 lives = 78 lives.

After 8 players quit the game, they each had 6 lives that were no longer in the game. So the total number of lives that were lost when 8 players quit is 8 players x 6 lives = 48 lives.

Therefore, the total number of lives remaining after 8 players quit is the initial total number of lives minus the number of lives lost, which is 78 lives - 48 lives = 30 lives. 

So, the remaining 5 players would have a total of 30 lives to continue playing the game.

Initially, the trivia team had 9 members. However, 3 members did not show up for the game. Therefore, only 6 members showed up and scored points.

Each member that showed up scored 2 points. So, the total number of points scored by each member is 6 members * 2 points = 12 points.

Therefore, the trivia team scored a total of 12 points.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12

Q: A trivia team had 9 members total, but during a game 3 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 2 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the trivia team had 9 members. However, during the game, 3 members didn't show up. So, the number of members who did show up is the initial number of members minus the members who didn't show up:

9 members - 3 members = 6 members showed up.

Since each member that showed up scored 2 points, we can calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of members who showed up by the points scored by each member:

6 members x 2 points each = 12 points total scored. 

Therefore, a total of 12 points were scored by the members who showed up for the game.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Alright, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there were 8 friends playing with 3 lives each.
   - 8 friends x 3 lives = 24 total lives

2. Three players quit the game.
   - 3 players x 3 lives = 9 lives lost

3. Calculate the total lives remaining after players quit.
   - 24 total lives - 9 lives lost = 15 lives remaining

Therefore, after 3 players quit, the total number of lives remaining for the players still in the game is 15 lives.

Q: There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 3 players quit. If each player left had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, there were 8 players with 3 lives each, so the total number of lives at the start was 8 players x 3 lives/player = 24 lives. 
When 3 players quit, they each had 3 lives, so the total number of lives they took with them was 3 players x 3 lives/player = 9 lives. 
To find the total number of lives remaining after the players quit, we can subtract the number of lives they took with them from the initial total: 24 lives - 9 lives = 15 lives. 
Therefore, after 3 players quit, there were 15 lives remaining among the players who continued playing.

Luke then split the remaining 30 pieces into 5 equal loads. To find out how many pieces will go in each small load, we can divide the total remaining pieces by the number of small loads.

30 pieces / 5 loads = 6 pieces per load.

Therefore, each of the small loads will have 6 pieces of clothing.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6

Q: Luke had 47 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 17 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! First, let's calculate how many pieces Luke had left after putting 17 into the first load. The initial number of clothing pieces was 47. After using 17 in the first load, Luke had 47 - 17 = 30 pieces left.

Next, we know that Luke decided to split the remaining 30 pieces into 5 equal loads. To find out how many pieces could go in each small load, we need to divide the total remaining pieces by the number of small loads.

So, 30 pieces ÷ 5 loads = 6 pieces per small load.

Therefore, Luke could put 6 pieces of clothing in each of the 5 small loads.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Let's start by determining how many points were scored by everyone else on Paige's team. Since Paige scored 11 points, the team's total score was 41 points. This means that the remaining points, scored by everyone else on the team, can be calculated by subtracting Paige's 11 points from the total:

Total points - Paige's points = Everyone else's points
41 - 11 = 30

Next, we need to determine how many players scored 6 points each to reach the total of 30 points. To do this, we divide the total points scored by each player (30) by the points scored by each individual player (6):

Total points scored by all other players / Points scored by each player = Number of players
30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 other players on Paige's team who each scored 6 points. Adding Paige (who scored 11 points) gives a total of 6 players on Paige's team.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step to determine the number of players on Paige's team.

1. Paige scored 11 points.
2. The rest of the team scored 6 points each.
3. Let's denote the number of players on Paige's team as "x".
4. So, the total points scored by the rest of the team (excluding Paige) = 6 * (x - 1), where (x - 1) represents the number of players other than Paige.
5. Given that the total points scored by the team is 41, we can write the equation as:
11 (Paige's points) + 6 * (x - 1) (Rest of the team's points) = 41
6. Simplifying the equation:
11 + 6x - 6 = 41
7. Combining like terms:
6x + 5 = 41
8. Solving for x:
6x = 36
x = 6

Therefore, there were 6 players on Paige's team.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6

1. Paige scored 11 points.
2. The rest of the team scored 6 points each.
3. Let's denote the number of players on Paige's team as x. 
4. Therefore, the total number of points scored by everyone else on the team is 6(x-1) because Paige has already been accounted for.
5. The total points scored by the team is the sum of Paige's points and the points scored by everyone else: 11 + 6(x-1) = 41.
6. Now, we can solve for x:
11 + 6(x-1) = 41
11 + 6x - 6 = 41
6x + 5 = 41
6x = 36
x = 6

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, there were 46 books to put away, but the librarian takes 10 books, so only 46 - 10 = 36 books are left for Oliver to put away. 

Now, let's figure out how many shelves Oliver will need to accommodate the 36 books. Since he can fit 4 books on each shelf, we can calculate the number of shelves by dividing the total number of remaining books by the number of books that can fit on one shelf:  

36 books ÷ 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining 36 books.

Q: Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Oliver initially had 46 books to put away. However, the librarian took 10 books, leaving Oliver with 46 - 10 = 36 books to put away. 

Since Oliver can fit 4 books on each shelf, we can find the number of shelves he will need by dividing the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 

36 books ÷ 4 books/shelf = 9 shelves

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9 shelves.

Q: Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initial number of seeds = 41

Seeds planted in big garden = 29

Seeds planted in small gardens = 41 - 29 = 12

Seeds planted in each small garden = 4

Number of small gardens = (Total seeds planted in small gardens) / (Seeds planted in each small garden) = 12 / 4 = 3

Therefore, Emily had 3 small gardens.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3

Q: Edward made 37 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 21 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 2 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Edward made 37 dollars mowing lawns over the summer.
2. Edward spent 21 dollars buying new mower blades.

To find out how much money Edward has left after buying the new mower blades, we need to subtract the cost of the blades from the total amount he made:

37 dollars - 21 dollars = 16 dollars

So, Edward has 16 dollars left after buying the blades.

Now, to determine how many 2 dollar games he could buy with the money he has left, we need to divide the remaining amount by the cost of each game:

16 dollars ÷ 2 dollars/game = 8 games

Therefore, Edward could buy 8 two-dollar games with the money he had left.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Initially, Edward had $37 from mowing lawns. He then spent $21 on new mower blades. To calculate how much money he had left after buying the blades, we subtract the amount spent from the amount he started with. So, $37 - $21 = $16. Edward had $16 left. Each 2-dollar game would cost $2. To find out how many games he could buy with the money he had left, we divide the amount of money remaining by the cost of each game. In this case, $16 ÷ $2 = 8. Edward could buy 8 two-dollar games with the money he had left after buying the mower blades.

Q: A pet store had 64 puppies. In one day they sold 28 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the pet store had 64 puppies. They sold 28 puppies, leaving 64 - 28 = 36 puppies remaining. These 36 puppies were then put into cages with 4 puppies in each cage.

To find out how many cages were used, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage:

Number of cages = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies in each cage
Number of cages = 36 puppies / 4 puppies
Number of cages = 9 cages

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages to house the remaining 36 puppies.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the company invited 18 people to the luncheon.

2. However, 12 people didn't show up, so we need to subtract those who didn't show up from the total number of people invited.
   Total people invited: 18
   People who didn't show up: 12
   People who showed up: 18 - 12 = 6

3. If each table holds 3 people, we need to figure out how many tables are required for the 6 people who showed up.
   Number of people showing up: 6
   People per table: 3
   Tables needed = Number of people showing up / People per table

So, the company needs:
Tables = 6 people / 3 people per table
Tables = 2 tables

Therefore, the company needs 2 tables for the 6 people who showed up to the luncheon.

1. Initially, the pet store had 78 puppies.
2. On one day, they sold 30 puppies.
3. Thus, the number of puppies remaining after the sale is: 78 - 30 = 48 puppies.
4. Next, they put the remaining puppies into cages with 8 in each cage.
5. To find out how many cages they used, divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage: 48 puppies ÷ 8 puppies/cage = 6 cages.
So, the pet store used 6 cages to house the remaining puppies.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6

Q: A pet store had 78 puppies. In one day they sold 30 of them and put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage. How many cages did they use?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. The pet store initially had 78 puppies.
2. On one day, they sold 30 puppies.
3. The remaining number of puppies = 78 - 30 = 48 puppies.

Now, the remaining 48 puppies were put into cages with 8 puppies each. To find out how many cages were used, we can divide the total number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage:

Number of cages = Remaining puppies / Puppies in each cage
Number of cages = 48 / 8
Number of cages = 6

Therefore, the pet store used 6 cages to house the remaining 48 puppies.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6

Q: Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Emily scored 23 points, and the other players each scored 2 points. Let's denote the number of other players as x.

2. The total points scored is 39, so we can set up an equation:
23 (points scored by Emily) + 2x (points scored by other players) = 39

3. Simplifying the equation:
23 + 2x = 39

4. Subtracting 23 from both sides:
2x = 16

5. Dividing by 2:
x = 8

Therefore, there were 8 other players on Emily's team. Adding Emily herself, the total number of players on the team is 8 + 1 = 9.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Q: Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, let's figure out how many points were scored collectively by all the players except Emily. Since Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each, the total points scored by everyone else can be calculated as:

Total points scored by everyone else = Total points scored - Points scored by Emily
Total points scored by everyone else = 39 - 23 = 16

Since each player besides Emily scored 2 points, the remaining 16 points were scored by (16 / 2) = 8 other players on Emily's team.

Therefore, Emily's team consists of Emily and 8 other players, for a total of 9 players on the team.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

Q: Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Let's start by determining the number of points scored by the other players. If Emily scored 23 points and the total score was 39 points, the other players scored 39 - 23 = 16 points combined.

Since each of the other players scored 2 points each, we can divide the total points scored by the other players (16) by the points scored by each player (2) to find the number of players on Emily's team. 

16 ÷ 2 = 8

Therefore, there were 8 other players on Emily's team, in addition to Emily herself. So the total number of players on Emily's team was 8 (other players) + 1 (Emily) = 9 players in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kaleb started out with 76 old games.
2. He sold 46 of them.
3. To find out how many games he had left after selling 46, we need to subtract the number of games sold from the initial amount: 76 - 46 = 30 games.

Now, we have 30 games remaining. The next step is to pack these games into boxes with 5 games each.

To find out how many boxes Kaleb will need, we can divide the total number of games by the number of games in each box:

Q: Kaleb was selling his old games. He started out with 76 but sold 46 of them. He packed the rest up putting 5 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, we start with the initial quantity of games Kaleb had, which was 76. Then, we subtract the number of games he sold, which was 46. 

Initial quantity = 76
Quantity sold = 46

Remaining quantity = Initial quantity - Quantity sold
Remaining quantity = 76 - 46 = 30 games

Since Kaleb packed 5 games into each box, we need to determine how many boxes he used to pack the remaining 30 games. To do this, we divide the remaining quantity (30 games) by the number of games in each box (5 games per box).

Number of boxes used = Remaining quantity / Number of games in each box
Number of boxes used = 30 / 5 = 6 boxes

Therefore, Kaleb had to use 6 boxes to pack up the remaining games.

Q: Nancy was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 52 seeds and planted 28 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Nancy have?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Alright, let's start by calculating the number of seeds Nancy planted in total. 

For the big garden, she planted 28 seeds.
For the small gardens, she planted 4 seeds each.

28 seeds went into the big garden, and each small garden took 4 seeds. So the total number of seeds planted is 28 (big garden) + 4x (small gardens).

Given that she started with 52 seeds in total, we can set up an equation to find out how many small gardens she had:
52 = 28 + 4x

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, there were 25 students who tried out. Out of those, 15 students didn't get picked for the team. 

If we subtract the 15 students who didn't get picked from the initial 25 students, we get:

25 - 15 = 10 students remaining

Since the remaining students were put into 2 groups, we can divide the 10 students equally between the 2 groups:

10 students / 2 groups = 5 students in each group

Therefore, there would be 5 students in each group.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Of the 25 students who tried out for the trivia teams, 15 were not picked for the team. This means 25 - 15 = 10 students were selected for the trivia teams as the remaining quantity.

Now, as the question states that these 10 students are to be divided into 2 groups, you can simply divide the total number of students (10) by the number of groups (2) to find out how many students would be in each group. 

10 students ÷ 2 groups = 5 students in each group 

So, there would be 5 students in each group if the 10 students were divided into 2 groups.

Q: Sarah had 60 homework problems. She finished 20 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Sarah initially had 60 homework problems.
2. She finished 20 of them, so the number of problems remaining is 60 - 20 = 40.
3. She still had 5 pages of problems to do. Since the number of problems remaining is 40, and each page has the same number of problems, we need to find out how many problems are on each page.
4. We can divide the remaining problems by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page. So, 40 problems remaining / 5 pages = 8 problems per page.

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8

Q: Katie's team won their dodgeball game and scored 12 points total. If Katie scored 4 of the points and everyone else scored 4 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! Let's break it down step by step:

1. The total points scored by Katie and the rest of the team is 12.
2. Katie scored 4 points, which means the rest of the team scored (12 - 4) = 8 points.
3. Each of the other players scored 4 points each.
4. To find out how many players there are in total, divide the 8 points scored by the rest of the team by the points per player: 8 points ÷ 4 points per player = 2 players.
5. Katie and the 2 other players make up the team, so Katie's team consists of 1 (Katie) + 2 (other players) = 3 players.

Therefore, there are 3 players on Katie's team.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3

Q: Katie's team won their dodgeball game and scored 12 points total. If Katie scored 4 of the points and everyone else scored 4 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! We can apply a systematic approach to solve this problem. First, we know that Katie scored 4 points, and the rest of the team collectively scored 8 points (4 points each for the other players). This gives us a total of 12 points scored by the team.

Let's denote the number of players on Katie's team as "x." Katie scored 4 points, so the remaining players (x-1) collectively scored 8 points: (x-1) * 4 = 8(x-1) points

Now, to find the total number of players on the team, we add Katie's score (4 points) to the points scored by the rest of the players (8 points): 4 + 8(x-1) = 12

Solving this equation:
4 + 8x - 8 = 12
8x - 4 = 12
8x = 16
x = 2

Therefore, the total number of players on Katie's team is 2.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

- Megan baked 71 cupcakes for the bake sale.
- Todd ate 43 of those cupcakes.

To calculate how many cupcakes are left after Todd ate 43 of them, we subtract the number Todd ate from the total Megan baked:

71 cupcakes - 43 cupcakes = 28 cupcakes remaining

Now, we know there are 28 cupcakes left after Todd ate his share. Next, we need to determine how many packages Megan can make if she puts 7 cupcakes in each package. To do this, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package:

28 cupcakes ÷ 7 cupcakes per package = 4 packages

Therefore, Megan can make 4 packages of cupcakes with the remaining 28 cupcakes.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Let's first calculate how many pictures Wendy put in the first album with 27 pictures:

Initial total pictures uploaded: 45
Pictures in the first album: 27

Now, let's calculate how many pictures Wendy put in the remaining 9 albums:

Remaining pictures = Total pictures - Pictures in first album
Remaining pictures = 45 - 27
Remaining pictures = 18

Since Wendy put the remaining pictures into 9 different albums, we need to divide the remaining pictures by the number of albums:
Pictures in each of the 9 remaining albums = Remaining pictures / Number of remaining albums
Pictures in each of the 9 remaining albums = 18 / 9
Pictures in each of the 9 remaining albums = 2

Therefore, Wendy put 27 pictures in the first album and 2 pictures in each of the 9 remaining albums.

Q: The cafeteria had 50 apples. For lunch they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! 
Starting with 50 apples in the cafeteria, 5 apples were given to students, leaving 45 apples (50 - 5 = 45). 
Next, we need to calculate how many pies can be made from the remaining 45 apples. Each pie requires 5 apples, so we divide the remaining apples by the number needed for each pie: 
45 apples ÷ 5 apples per pie = 9 pies. 
Therefore, the cafeteria could make 9 pies with the remaining apples.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

Q: The cafeteria had 50 apples. For lunch they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the cafeteria had 50 apples. If they handed out 5 apples to students, the number of apples left would be 50 - 5 = 45 apples. To determine how many pies they can make from the remaining apples, divide the total remaining apples by the number of apples required for each pie. In this case, with 45 apples remaining and each pie requiring 5 apples, the cafeteria could make 45 ÷ 5 = 9 pies. So, they could make 9 pies with the remaining apples.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9

Q: A company invited 45 people to a luncheon, but 35 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 2 people each, how many tables do they need?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! Let's break it down:

1. Initially available items (people invited): 45
2. Consumed or discarded items (people who didn't show up): 35
3. Remaining items (people who attended): 

To calculate the remaining people who attended the luncheon, we can subtract the number of people who didn't show up from the initial count:

Remaining people = Initially invited - People who didn't show up
Remaining people = 45 - 35
Remaining people = 10

Since each table holds 2 people, we need to determine how many tables are required to accommodate these 10 remaining people:

Number of tables = Remaining people / People per table
Number of tables = 10 / 2
Number of tables = 5

Therefore, the company needs 5 tables to accommodate the 10 people who attended the luncheon.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5

Certainly! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the company invited 45 people to the luncheon.
2. However, 35 people did not show up for the event.
3. Therefore, the number of people who actually attended the luncheon is 45 - 35 = 10 people.

Now, since each table holds 2 people, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of people attending by the seating capacity of each table:

Number of tables = Number of people / Seating capacity per table
Number of tables = 10 people / 2 people per table
Number of tables = 5 tables

Therefore, the company would need 5 tables for the 10 people who showed up to the luncheon.

Q: Isabel baked 39 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 21 of them how many packages could she make if she put 3 cupcake in each package?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Isabel baked 39 cupcakes. Todd ate 21 of them. So, the number of cupcakes remaining after Todd ate them is 39 - 21 = 18 cupcakes. 

Isabel wants to put 3 cupcakes in each package. To find out how many packages she can make, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes remaining by the number of cupcakes in each package. 

Therefore, 18 cupcakes ÷ 3 cupcakes per package = 6 packages. Isabel can make 6 packages with the remaining 18 cupcakes.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6

Q: Sarah had 55 homework problems. She finished 6 of them but still had 7 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Sarah had 55 homework problems.
2. Sarah finished 6 of the problems, so she had 55 - 6 = 49 problems left to do.
3. She still had 7 pages of problems left, so let's denote the number of problems on each page as x.
4. If 7 pages each have x problems on them, then the total number of problems left to do (49) is equal to 7x.
5. Therefore, we can form an equation to find x: 7x = 49
6. Solving for x, we get x = 49 / 7 = 7

Thus, there are 7 problems on each page.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! 

Step 1: Initially Sarah had 55 homework problems.
Step 2: She finished 6 of them, leaving 55 - 6 = 49 problems.
Step 3: Sarah still had 7 pages of problems to do, and she had already finished 6 problems, so 7 pages of problems - 1 page of problems (already finished) = 6 pages of problems left.
Step 4: To find out how many problems are on each page, we divide the total remaining problems by the number of pages remaining: 49 problems / 6 pages = 8.17 problems per page.

Since we can't have fractions of problems, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each page has 8 problems on it.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8

Q: Paige picked 53 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one. If 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Paige picked 53 flowers for the wedding.
2. 18 of those flowers wilted before the wedding.
3. Number of flowers Paige can still use = 53 - 18 = 35.

Since Paige can use 35 flowers to make bouquets with 7 flowers in each one, we can calculate the number of bouquets she can still make:

Number of bouquets = Total flowers / Flowers per bouquet
Number of bouquets = 35 / 7 = 5

Therefore, Paige can still make 5 bouquets for her friend's wedding.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Step 1: Paige picked 53 flowers for the wedding.
Step 2: She was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one.
Step 3: To calculate how many bouquets she can make, divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet: 53 flowers / 7 flowers per bouquet = 7.57 bouquets
Step 4: Since she can't have a fraction of a bouquet, she can make 7 complete bouquets.

Step 5: Unfortunately, 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, which means she now has 53 - 18 = 35 flowers left.
Step 6: To determine how many bouquets she can still make with the remaining flowers, divide the total number of flowers left by the number of flowers in each bouquet: 35 flowers / 7 flowers per bouquet = 5 bouquets.

Therefore, Paige could still make 5 bouquets for her friend's wedding.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, the waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left, that means 22 - 14 = 8 customers remained in his section.

If the remaining customers were seated in tables with 4 people at each table, we can find the number of tables by dividing the total number of remaining customers by the number of people at each table. So, 8 customers / 4 people per table = 2 tables.

Therefore, the waiter had 2 tables in his section after 14 customers left.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. The waiter initially had 22 customers in his section.
2. 14 customers left, so those 14 customers were consumed or discarded.
3. The remaining customers stayed and were seated at tables with 4 people each.

To find out how many tables the waiter had, we can start by calculating the number of remaining customers after the 14 left:
Initial customers - Customers who left = Remaining customers
22 - 14 = 8 remaining customers

Since each table had 4 people, we can determine how many tables the remaining customers would have sat at:
Number of tables = Remaining customers / People per table
Number of tables = 8 / 4
Number of tables = 2

Therefore, the waiter had 2 tables in his section.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! To determine how many games Luke had remaining after selling, we subtract the number of games he sold from the number of games he started with:  
39 games - 19 games = 20 games  

Now, Luke has 20 games left. Since he packed 4 games into each box, we can calculate how many boxes he needed by dividing the total number of games by the number of games in each box:  
20 games ÷ 4 games per box = 5 boxes  

Therefore, Luke needed 5 boxes to pack up the remaining games.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, we need to calculate the number of games Luke had left after selling 19 of them.

Initial games = 39
Games sold = 19

Games left = Initial games - Games sold
Games left = 39 - 19
Games left = 20

Next, we need to determine how many boxes were needed to pack the remaining 20 games with 4 games in each box.

Number of games per box = 4
Games left = 20

Number of boxes = Games left / Number of games per box
Number of boxes = 20 / 4
Number of boxes = 5

Therefore, Luke would need 5 boxes to pack the remaining 20 games.

Q: A company invited 24 people to a luncheon, but 10 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 7 people each, how many tables do they need?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the company invited 24 people to the luncheon.
2. 10 people didn't show up, so these 10 people are no longer attending the event.
3. This means that 24 - 10 = 14 people showed up to the luncheon.
4. Each table holds 7 people, so to determine how many tables are needed, we divide the total number of people (14) by the number of people each table can hold (7).

14 people / 7 people per table = 2 tables

Therefore, the company would need 2 tables for the 14 people who showed up to the luncheon.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2

Sure! Let's break it down:

1. Initially, the company invited 24 people to the luncheon.
2. However, 10 people didn't show up, which means they didn't attend the luncheon.
3. Therefore, the number of people who attended the luncheon is 24 - 10 = 14 people.

Now, they want to seat 7 people per table. To find out how many tables they need, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people per table:

Number of tables needed = Total number of people / People per table
Number of tables needed = 14 people / 7 people per table
Number of tables needed = 2 tables

Therefore, the company will need 2 tables for the 14 people who showed up at the luncheon.

Q: Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Starting with a hypothetically assumed number of players P on Bianca's team, we can set up an equation to solve for P. If Bianca scored 45 points and everyone else scored 6 points each, the equation can be expressed as:

45 + 6(P-1) = 75

Let's now solve this equation to find the number of players P on Bianca's team.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is P = 7

Therefore, there were 7 players on Bianca's team.

Q: Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
We can break down the problem step by step:

1. Bianca scored 45 points.
2. The rest of the team scored 6 points each.
3. Let 'x' be the number of other players on Bianca's team. They each scored 6 points.
4. The total points scored is 75.
5. Therefore, the equation to represent this situation is: 45 + 6x = 75.

Now, we can solve for 'x':

45 + 6x = 75
6x = 30
x = 5

So, there were 5 other players on Bianca's team besides her. Therefore, the total number of players on Bianca's team is 1 (Bianca) + 5 (other players) = 6 players in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
To determine the number of players on Bianca's team, we can start by subtracting the points Bianca scored from the total points. 

Total points - Bianca's points = Points scored by the rest of the team
75 - 45 = 30

Since each of the remaining players scored 6 points each, we can divide the points scored by the rest of the team by the points scored by each player to find the number of players on the team. 

Number of players = Points scored by the rest of the team / Points scored by each player
30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 players on Bianca's team, including Bianca herself.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Emily received 54 pieces of candy initially. After eating 33 pieces, the number of candies remaining would be:

54 pieces - 33 pieces = 21 pieces

Since Emily wants to make piles of 7 pieces each, we need to find out how many 7-piece piles she can make from the remaining 21 pieces. We can do this by dividing the remaining 21 pieces by 7:

21 pieces / 7 pieces per pile = 3 piles

Therefore, Emily can make 3 piles of 7 pieces each from the candies she has left after eating 33 pieces.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3

Q: For Halloween Bianca received 32 pieces of candy. She ate 12 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 5 in each pile. How many piles could she make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Certainly! To find out how many candy pieces Bianca has left after eating 12, we will subtract the number of candies eaten from the total candies received:

Total candies received = 32
Candies eaten = 12

Remaining candies = Total candies received - Candies eaten
Remaining candies = 32 - 12 = 20

Next, we need to determine how many piles of 5 candies Bianca can make with the 20 candies left. We can do this by dividing the number of candies left by the size of each pile:

Number of piles = Remaining candies / Candies per pile
Number of piles = 20 / 5 = 4

Therefore, Bianca can make 4 piles of 5 candies each with the remaining 20 candies.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4

$68 - $47 = $21

Roger had $21 left. To determine how many $7 toys he could buy with $21, we divide the total amount remaining by the cost of each toy:

$21 ÷ $7 = 3

Roger could buy 3 $7 toys with the money he had left after buying the game.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3

Q: Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 4 tickets, how many rides could he go on?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Tom initially bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth, leaving him with 40 - 28 = 12 tickets for rides. 
Since each ride costs 4 tickets, Tom can go on 12 / 4 = 3 rides. 
Therefore, Tom could go on 3 rides with the remaining tickets he has.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: The cafeteria had 75 apples. For lunch they handed out 19 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the cafeteria had 75 apples.
2. They handed out 19 apples to students, so 75 - 19 = 56 apples were left.
3. If each pie takes 8 apples, we can divide the remaining apples by 8 to determine how many pies they could make.

So, 56 / 8 = 7 pies. Therefore, they could make 7 pies using the remaining apples after handing out 19 to students.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure! Initially, the cafeteria had 75 apples. They handed out 19 apples to students. So, the remaining apples for making pies would be 75 - 19 = 56 apples. To find out how many pies they can make, we need to determine how many sets of 8 apples can be made from the remaining 56 apples. This can be done by dividing 56 by 8. So, 56 ÷ 8 = 7. Therefore, the cafeteria could make 7 pies with the remaining apples.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7

Q: The cafeteria had 75 apples. For lunch they handed out 19 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 75 apples in the cafeteria.
19 apples were handed out to students for lunch.

To calculate the number of apples remaining after handing out apples for lunch:
75 (initial apples) - 19 (apples handed out) = 56 apples remaining

If each pie takes 8 apples, we can determine the number of pies they could make by dividing the total number of remaining apples by the number of apples required per pie:
56 (remaining apples) ÷ 8 (apples per pie) = 7 pies

Therefore, the cafeteria could make 7 pies with the remaining apples.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7

Q: Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 14 of them how many packages could she make if she put 8 cupcake in each package?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Alright, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sarah baked 38 cupcakes.
2. Todd ate 14 cupcakes.
3. To find out how many cupcakes Sarah has left after Todd ate some, we subtract the number Todd ate (14) from the initial number Sarah baked (38):
   38 cupcakes - 14 cupcakes = 24 cupcakes

Sarah has 24 cupcakes left after Todd ate 14 of them.

Now, if Sarah wants to make packages of 8 cupcakes each, we divide the number of cupcakes she has left (24) by the number of cupcakes per package (8) to find out how many packages she can make:

24 cupcakes ÷ 8 cupcakes per package = 3 packages

Therefore, Sarah can make 3 packages of cupcakes with the 24 cupcakes she has left.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3

Q: Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Initially, Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook into different albums. She put 37 pics into one album and the remainder into 2 different albums. 

Therefore, the total number of pictures distributed between the albums would be: 
37 (pics in one album) + 2x (pics in each of the two albums, where x is what we need to find) = 41 (total uploaded pictures)

Now we can set up an equation to solve for x: 
37 + 2x = 41 

Subtracting 37 from both sides: 
2x = 41 - 37 
2x = 4 

Dividing by 2 on both sides, we get: 
x = 2 

So, there were 2 pictures in each of the 2 different albums, and 37 pictures in the first album.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 pictures were in each of the 2 different albums, and 37 pictures were in the first album.

Q: Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
Step 1: Start with the total number of pictures Nancy uploaded to Facebook, which is 41.

Step 2: Since Nancy put 37 pictures into one album, subtract 37 from the total to find out how many pictures remain: 41 - 37 = 4 pictures left.

Step 3: Divide the remaining 4 pictures equally into the 2 different albums: 4 ÷ 2 = 2 pictures in each album.

Therefore, Nancy put 37 pictures in one album and 2 pictures in each of the other two albums.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 37 pictures were in one album and 2 pictures were in each of the other two albums.

A: Let's think step by step, how many items were initially acquired and how many were consumed or discarded, to determine the final quantity remaining?
First, Nancy uploaded a total of 41 pictures. 
Then she put 37 pictures into one album.
This leaves her with 41 - 37 = 4 pictures to put into the other two albums.
Since these 4 pictures are split equally between the other two albums, each of those albums will have 4 / 2 = 2 pictures.
Therefore, there are 37 pictures in the first album and 2 pictures in each of the other two albums.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 37 pictures in one album and 2 pictures in each of the other two albums.
