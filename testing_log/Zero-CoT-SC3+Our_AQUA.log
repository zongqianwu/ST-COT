Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We are given that the car takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. This means that the angle of elevation is changing at a rate of 1.5° per minute (since 60° - 45° = 15° and it takes 10 minutes for this change to occur).

2. The car is moving towards the base of the tower at a uniform speed. This means that the rate at which the angle of elevation is changing is constant.

3. We need to find out after how much more time will the car reach the base of the tower. This time can be calculated by determining how long it will take for the angle of elevation to change from 60° to 90° (since the car will reach the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 90°).

4. The angle of elevation changing from 60° to 90° is a change of 30°. Since the rate at which the angle of elevation is changing is constant at 1.5° per minute, it will take 20 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 60° to 90° (since 30° divided by 1.5 = 20).

5. Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after 10 minutes (the time it took for the angle to change from 45° to 60°) + 20 minutes (the time it will take for the angle to change from 60° to 90°) = 30 minutes in total.

6. Let's calculate the value of the answer choices using this information. For example, for choice (A):

- 5(√3 + 1) = 5(1.73 + 1) = 5(2.73) = 13.65
- Since this is not equal to 30, (A) is not the correct answer. 

You can similarly evaluate the other answer choices to find the correct one. Let me know if you need further assistance with this problem or if you have any other questions!

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of these (E).

Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry and the concept of similar triangles. 

Let the height of the tower be H and the distance between the car and the base of the tower be D. When the car is at a point where the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is 45°, a right-angled triangle is formed with the tower's height, the distance to the tower, and the line of sight as its sides. When the angle of elevation changes to 60°, a new right-angled triangle is formed. 

The tangent of an angle in a right-angled triangle is the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the side adjacent to the angle. 

- When the angle of elevation is 45°: tan(45°) = H / D
- When the angle of elevation is 60°: tan(60°) = H / (D + x), where x is the additional distance the car travels from the first position. 

From the given information, we have:
tan(45°) = H / D and tan(60°) = H / (D + x)

Solving for H in the first equation gives H = D*tan(45°) = D
Substitute this into the second equation gives tan(60°) = D / (D + x)

Since tan(45°) = 1 and tan(60°) = √3, we have:
1 = D / (D + x)
1 = D + x
x = D

Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after traveling a distance equal to the height of the tower, which is D.

Now, we need to find the time taken to travel this distance. If the car is moving at a constant speed, the time to cover a certain distance is directly proportional to the distance.

Since the car took 10 minutes to change the angle of elevation from 45° to 60°, it covers D distance in 10 minutes. Therefore, it will take an additional 10 minutes to travel D distance (to reach the base of the tower).

So, the answer is 10 more minutes, which is not in the given choices. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of these

Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry and the concept of similar triangles.

Let's denote the height of the tower as H and the horizontal distance from the car to the base of the tower as D. The angle of elevation changing from 45° to 60° means that the car has traveled a certain distance closer to the base of the tower.

From the information given, we can set up the following trigonometric relationships:

tan(60°) = H / D  (where tan(60°) = √3)
tan(45°) = (H - x) / D  (where tan(45°) = 1)

We know that D is constant (since the car is moving at a uniform speed), so we can rewrite these equations as:

H = √3D
H - x = D

Solving for x, we get:
x = H - D
Substitute H = √3D into the equation:
x = √3D - D
x = (√3 - 1)D

The time it took the car to cover this distance is 10 minutes, so the speed of the car is the distance divided by the time, which is (D / 10) minutes.

To find the remaining time until the car reaches the base of the tower, we need to determine the total distance D. To do this, we can use the speed of the car to calculate the time it takes to cover the distance x = (√3 - 1)D. This time plus the initial 10 minutes will give us the total time needed for the car to reach the base of the tower.

Thus, the correct choice should be:
(C) 7(√3 – 1)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 7(√3 – 1)

Q: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's denote the original price of the item as "x".
2. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is 0.78x (100% - 22% = 78%).
3. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so they pay 0.78x - 20.
4. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, which can be expressed as (0.5x + 1.90).
5. Set up an equation: 0.78x - 20 = (0.5x + 1.90).
6. Solve the equation to find the value of x, which is the original price of the item.

By solving the equation in step 5, we can determine the original price of the item. If you need further assistance with the calculations or have any more questions, feel free to ask.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the equation:
0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90

Firstly, let's simplify the equation:
0.78x - 0.5x = 20 + 1.90
0.28x = 21.90

Now, solve for x:
x = 21.90 / 0.28
x ≈ 78.214

Therefore, the original price of the item is approximately $78.20 (option E).

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the original price of the item, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the price after the 22% discount:
Let x be the original price of the item.
After a 22% discount, the price is 0.78x (100% - 22% = 78%).

2. Calculate the final price after the $20 coupon is applied:
Final price = 0.78x - 20

3. Translate the given information into an equation:
The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price:
0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90

4. Solve for x:
0.78x - 0.5x = 20 + 1.90
0.28x = 21.90
x = 21.90 / 0.28
x = 78.21

Therefore, the original price of the item was $78.20. The answer choice (E) $78.20 matches our calculation.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) $78.20

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the original price of the item, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start by letting x be the original price of the item.

2. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is 0.78x (100% - 22% = 78% or 0.78 in decimal form).

3. The customer uses a $20-off coupon on this discounted price, so the final price paid by the customer is 0.78x - 20.

4. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, which can be mathematically stated as:

  0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90

5. Now, solve this equation for x to find the original price of the item.

Let's perform the calculations step by step:

0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90
0.28x = 21.90
x = 21.90 / 0.28
x = 78.21

Therefore, the original price of the item was $78.20. Hence, the correct answer choice is (E) $78.20.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) $78.20

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find a value that is a multiple of both 9 and 12, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two values. 

The LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. Therefore, the value that is a multiple of both 9 and 12 is 36.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine which value among the answer choices is a multiple of both 9 and 12, we need to find the common multiple of these two numbers. 

First, let's find the multiples of 9 and 12 to see where they overlap:

Q: Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12? Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 15 (C) 17 (D) 5 (E) 7
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find out which of the values is a multiple of both 9 and 12, we need to check if each value is divisible by both 9 and 12.

- (A) 36: This value is divisible by both 9 (since 36 ÷ 9 = 4) and 12 (since 36 ÷ 12 = 3). Therefore, 36 is a multiple of both 9 and 12.
- (B) 15: This value is not divisible by 9 (since 15 ÷ 9 = 1 with a remainder) or 12. Therefore, 15 is not a multiple of both 9 and 12.
- (C) 17: This value is not divisible by 9 or 12. Therefore, 17 is not a multiple of both 9 and 12.
- (D) 5: This value is not divisible by 9 or 12. Therefore, 5 is not a multiple of both 9 and 12.
- (E) 7: This value is not divisible by 9 or 12. Therefore, 7 is not a multiple of both 9 and 12.

So, the correct answer is (A) 36.

Q: If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur? Answer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we can use the complement rule.

The complement of at least one of two events happening is the probability that neither event happens. So, we can find the probability that at least one of the events occurs and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that neither occurs.

The probability that at least one of the events occurs is calculated by adding the individual probabilities and subtracting the probability that both events occur (since we don't want to count that twice).

So, \(P(\text{At least one}) = P(\text{Stock A increases}) + P(\text{Stock B increases}) - P(\text{Stock A and Stock B both increase})\)

Given:
\(P(\text{Stock A increases}) = 0.56\)
\(P(\text{Stock B increases}) = 0.74\)

Since the events are independent, the probability that both events occur is the product of their individual probabilities:
\(P(\text{Stock A and Stock B both increase}) = P(\text{Stock A increases}) \times P(\text{Stock B increases}) = 0.56 \times 0.74\)

Now, substitute the values in and calculate:
\(P(\text{At least one}) = 0.56 + 0.74 - (0.56 \times 0.74)\)

Finally, once we've found \(P(\text{At least one})\), we take the complement to find the probability that neither occurs:
\(P(\text{Neither}) = 1 - P(\text{At least one})\)

Calculate the values step by step and select the greatest value from the answer choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the probability step by step:

Given:
- Probability that Stock A will increase = 0.56
- Probability that Stock B will increase = 0.74

First, calculate the probability that either Stock A or Stock B will increase:
\[ P(\text{At least one}) = P(\text{Stock A increases}) + P(\text{Stock B increases}) - P(\text{Stock A and Stock B both increase}) \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ P(\text{At least one}) = 0.56 + 0.74 - (0.56 \times 0.74) \]

\[ P(\text{At least one}) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.56 \times 0.74 \]
\[ P(\text{At least one}) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.4144 \]
\[ P(\text{At least one}) = 0.8856 \]

Next, calculate the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase:
\[ P(\text{Neither}) = 1 - P(\text{At least one}) \]
\[ P(\text{Neither}) = 1 - 0.8856 \]
\[ P(\text{Neither}) = 0.1144 \]

Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase is approximately 0.1144.

Among the answer choices provided, the closest value is not among A to E. This means there might be a miscalculation in the step-by-step calculations provided earlier. Let's reevaluate the calculations.

Q: If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur? Answer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, you can use the formula for the probability of the complementary event:

P(neither Stock A nor Stock B increases) = 1 - [P(Stock A increases) + P(Stock B increases) - P(Stock A and Stock B both increase)]

Given:
P(Stock A increases) = 0.56
P(Stock B increases) = 0.74

To find the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs, we need to find the minimum value for the probability that both events occur. Since we want the greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs, we want the lowest possible value for the probability that both events occur. This happens when the two events are independent.

P(Stock A and Stock B both increase) = P(Stock A increases) * P(Stock B increases) = 0.56 * 0.74 = 0.4144

Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase is:

1 - [0.56 + 0.74 - 0.4144] = 1 - [1.2944] = 0.7056

So, the correct answer choice is (E) 0.63.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer choice is (E) 0.63.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the greatest value for the probability that neither of the events will occur, we can use the concept of complementary probability.

The probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
Similarly, the probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.

To find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we multiply the probabilities that both events will not occur:
P(neither A nor B increase) = P(A does not increase) * P(B does not increase)
P(neither A nor B increase) = 0.44 * 0.26
P(neither A nor B increase) = 0.1144

Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.26, which corresponds to option (B) 0.26.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the cost price of the article, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's assume the cost price of the article is 'C'.
2. The trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, which means the selling price (SP) is 120% of the cost price: SP = 1.2C.
3. Given that the selling price is Rs.360, we can write the equation as: 1.2C = 360.
4. Divide both sides of the equation by 1.2 to find the cost price: C = 360 / 1.2 = 300.

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300. So, the correct answer choice is (B) 300.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 300

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To calculate the cost price of the article, we can use the formula:

Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit

Given that the selling price is Rs.360 and the profit is 20%, we can calculate the cost price as follows:

Let the cost price be x.

Since the profit is 20%, the profit amount is 0.20x.

Therefore, the selling price is the sum of the cost price and profit:

x + 0.20x = 360
1.20x = 360
x = 360 / 1.20
x = 300

So, the cost price of the article is Rs.300, which corresponds to answer choice (B).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 300

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the cost price of the article, we need to know the selling price and the profit percentage. 

Given:

Profit percentage = 20%

Formula to calculate the cost price when profit percentage is given:
Cost price (CP) = (100 / (100 + profit percentage)) x Selling price

Plugging in the values:
CP = (100 / (100 + 20)) x 360
CP = (100 / 120) x 360
CP = (5 / 6) x 360
CP = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300. So, the correct answer choice is (B) 300.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 300

Q: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can work step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the original number of black marbles in the bag.
- In the first round, all 20 marbles were white.
- In the second round, 1 marble was black. This means the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1 out of 20, or 5%.

Step 2: Determine the total number of marbles in the bag.
- Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out in the second round represents their percentage in the bag, and the percentage is 5%, the total number of marbles in the bag must be divisible by 20, as that was the number of marbles pulled out in each round. This leaves us with answer choices B (200) and E (3200).

Step 3: Test the answer choices to find the correct total number of marbles in the bag.
- If we have 200 marbles in total, and 5% of them are black, we should have 10 black marbles in the bag. Let's see if this fits the scenario:
    - Initially, there were 20 white marbles, so to have 10 black marbles out of 200 means that 190 marbles are white. 
    - After returning all marbles to the bag, if we draw 20 marbles again, the probability of drawing a black marble is (10 black + 190 white) / 200 marbles = 10%.
    - This probability does not match, as we were looking for a 5% probability in the second round, so we can eliminate answer choice B.

Step 4: Test the remaining answer choice E - 3200 marbles.
- If there are 3200 marbles in the bag, and 5% of them are black, we should have 160 black marbles in the bag.
    - Initially, there were 20 white marbles, so to have 160 black marbles out of 3200 means that 3020 marbles are white.
    - After returning all marbles to the bag, if we draw 20 marbles again, the probability of drawing a black marble is (160 black + 3020 white) / 3200 marbles = 5%.
    - This probability matches the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is option E - 3200 marbles in total.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is 3200 (E)

Q: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were only white marbles in the bag, and 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black before being placed back in the bag.

2. This means that after the first round, all 20 marbles in the bag are black.

3. In the second round, another 20 marbles were pulled out, and 1 of them was black.

4. Since 1 out of 20 marbles pulled out in the second round was black, we can infer that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5% (1 out of 20 is 5%).

5. If 5% of the marbles in the bag are black, and we know that all 20 marbles in the bag after the first round are black, we can say that these 20 marbles represent 5% of the total number of marbles in the bag.

6. Using proportions, we can calculate the total number of marbles in the bag (Q) as follows:
   20 marbles = 5% of Q
   5/100 = 20/Q
   Q = 20 * 100 / 5
   Q = 400

Therefore, the bag currently holds a total of 400 marbles. So, the answer is (D) 400.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 400

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, we need to analyze the information given and calculate the number of black marbles at each step.

1. Initially, there are only white marbles in the bag.
2. 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and put back. This means all 20 marbles are now black.
3. Another 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 is black. This means the ratio of black marbles from the second pull is 1:20.

To find the total number of marbles in the bag currently Q, we need to set up the following equation based on the information we have:

Let x be the total number of marbles in the bag currently Q:
1 black marble out of 20 marbles from the second pull = 1 black marble out of x total marbles
1/20 = 1/x

Solving for x gives:
x = 20/1
x = 20

Therefore, the bag currently holds 20 marbles in total. The correct answer choice is (A) 20.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 40

Q: Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct? Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to consider the following:

1. For the first letter: There are 26 choices (from A to Z).
2. For the second letter: Since it needs to be distinct from the first letter, there are 25 choices left.
3. For the first number: There are 10 choices (from 0 to 9).
4. For the second number: Since it needs to be distinct from the first number, there are 9 choices left.

To find the total number of distinct bike numbers, we multiply the number of choices for each step:

26 choices for the first letter × 25 choices for the second letter × 10 choices for the first number × 9 choices for the second number.

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is: 26 × 25 × 10 × 9 = 58500.

So, the closest answer choice is (B) 64543, as it is the nearest whole number to 58500.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 64543

Q: Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct? Answer Choices: (A) 74453 (B) 64543 (C) 74325 (D) 65000 (E) 97656
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to consider the following:

1. Number of ways to choose 2 distinct letters from the 26 alphabets = 26P2
2. Number of ways to choose 2 distinct numbers from 0 to 9 = 10P2

As we need distinct letters, we need to choose 2 distinct letters out of 26, so we use permutation.
Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed = 26P2 * 10P2

Calculating the values:
26P2 = 26! / (26-2)! = 26 * 25 = 650
10P2 = 10! / (10-2)! = 10 * 9 = 90

Multiplying the results:
650 * 90 = 58500

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is 58,500.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to consider the following:

1. The number of distinct letters needed: Since we are forming bike numbers using 2 letters, the letters need to be distinct to have different combinations for each position.

2. The number of distinct numbers needed: We have 10 digits (0 to 9) to choose from for each number slot, which means the numbers need to be distinct as well.

3. Multiplication principle: To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed, we multiply the number of choices for each position (letters and numbers) together.

Let's calculate:

Number of distinct choices for the first letter = 26 (any letter from A to Z)
Number of distinct choices for the second letter = 25 (since it needs to be different from the first letter)
Number of distinct choices for the first number = 10 (0 to 9)
Number of distinct choices for the second number = 9 (since it needs to be different from the first number)

Total number of distinct bike numbers = 26 * 25 * 10 * 9 = 58,500

Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not present. The correct answer is not listed among the given options. The correct calculation yielded 58,500 distinct bike numbers, which is not present in the provided answer choices A, B, C, D, or E.

Q: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total distance covered by the train is not given, so let's denote the distance as D miles.
2. The train covers 1/4th of the total distance before it starts raining. This means it covers D/4 miles at a speed of 100 miles/hour.
3. The remaining distance to cover will be 3D/4 miles.
4. After it starts raining, the train slows down to a speed of 75 miles/hour for the rest of the journey.
5. We know the total time taken for the entire journey is 10 hours.
6. For the first part of the journey at 100 miles/hour, the time taken is D/4 / 100 = D/400 hours.
7. For the second part of the journey at 75 miles/hour, the time taken is 3D/4 / 75 = 3D/300 hours.
8. The total time taken for the journey is the sum of these two times: D/400 + 3D/300 = 10 hours.
9. Simplifying the equation, we get D/400 + D/100 = 10.
10. Combining the terms, we get 5D/400 = 10.
11. Solving for D, we get D = 800 miles, which is the total distance.
12. Finally, to find the total journey duration, we add the time taken for each part of the journey: 10 hours.

Therefore, the total journey duration is 10 hours. So, the correct answer choice is (A) 10.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 10

Q: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the total distance the train needs to travel. Since the train takes 10 hours to reach its destination at a speed of 100 miles per hour, the total distance can be calculated as:
Total Distance = Speed * Time
Total Distance = 100 mph * 10 hours
Total Distance = 1000 miles

2. Next, we need to determine the distance covered when the train starts to slow down due to rain. Since the train has covered a quarter of the total distance, the distance covered at that point can be calculated as:
Distance Covered at 25% = Total Distance * 0.25
Distance Covered at 25% = 1000 miles * 0.25
Distance Covered at 25% = 250 miles

3. Calculate the remaining distance to be covered after slowing down. The remaining distance can be calculated as:
Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Distance Covered at 25%
Remaining Distance = 1000 miles - 250 miles
Remaining Distance = 750 miles

4. Now calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour. The time taken to cover the remaining distance can be calculated as:
Time taken = Distance / Speed
Time taken = 750 miles / 75 mph
Time taken = 10 hours

5. Finally, find the total journey duration by adding the time taken to cover the remaining distance with the initial 10 hours:
Total Journey Duration = 10 hours (initial) + 10 hours (remaining)
Total Journey Duration = 20 hours

Therefore, the correct answer is not listed in the answer choices provided. The total journey duration is 20 hours.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not available, as the correct total journey duration is 20 hours based on the calculations provided.

Q: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To find the total journey duration, we need to consider two different segments of the journey: one at 100 miles/hour and another at 75 miles/hour.

Let's start breaking down the information:
1. The train takes 10 hours to reach its destination at 100 miles/hour.
2. After covering a quarter of the distance at 100 miles/hour, the train slows down to 75 miles/hour.
3. We know the total journey duration is more than 10 hours since the train slows down after covering some distance.

Let's calculate the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance at 100 miles/hour:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance covered at 100 miles/hour = 100 miles/hour × 10 hours = 1000 miles.
Distance of the whole journey = 4 × 1000 miles (since a quarter is covered first)
Distance covered at 100 miles/hour = 1/4 × Total distance
1000 miles = 1/4 × Total distance
Total distance = 1000 miles × 4 = 4000 miles

Now, calculate the time taken for the remaining 3/4 of the journey at 75 miles/hour:
Distance to be covered at 75 miles/hour = 3/4 × 4000 miles = 3000 miles
Time taken at 75 miles/hour = Distance / Speed = 3000 miles / 75 miles/hour = 40 hours

Finally, calculate the total journey duration:
Total journey duration = Time taken at 100 miles/hour + Time taken at 75 miles/hour
Total journey duration = 10 hours (100 miles/hour) + 40 hours (75 miles/hour) = 50 hours

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given answer choices. So, your best course of action would be to select "None of the above" or provide the closest alternative.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Not provided. It seems that the correct answer is not among the provided options, so it would be best to select "None of the above" or the closest alternative.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we first need to find the minimum number of students who attended either event.

Since at least 45% attended the prom night, there were at least 0.45 * 200 = 90 students who attended the prom night.

Similarly, since at least 35% took part in the debating session, there were at least 0.35 * 200 = 70 students who took part in the debating session.

The maximum number of students who could have attended either event is the sum of students who attended the prom night and those who took part in the debating session, minus the total number of students. This gives us 90 + 70 - 200 = 160 students.

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 200 (total students) - 160 (students who attended either event) = 40.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to find the overlap between the two groups and subtract this from the total number of students.

Given:
- At least 45% of 200 students attended the prom night, so the minimum number of students attending the prom night is 45% of 200, which is 0.45 x 200 = 90 students.
- At least 35% of 200 students took part in the debating session, so the minimum number of students participating in the debating session is 35% of 200, which is 0.35 x 200 = 70 students.

To find the maximum overlap, we should assume that all 90 students who attended the prom night also took part in the debating session. Hence, the maximum number of students who attended both events is 90 students.

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is the total number of students (200) minus the maximum number of students who attended both events (90), which equals 200 - 90 = 110 students.

So, the correct answer choice is (E) 110.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to find the students who did not attend either event.

First, let's find the minimum number of students who attended each event:
- 45% of 200 students attended the prom night, which is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students.
- 35% of 200 students participated in the debating session, which is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students.

Since we're looking for the maximum number of students who did not attend either event, we need to consider the overlap between the two groups. The minimum number of students who attended both events is the lesser of the two numbers, which is 70 students (the number who participated in the debating session).

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is the total number of students (200) minus the students who attended at least one event (90 + 70 - 70, to remove the overlap) which equals 200 - 90 = 110 students.

So, the correct answer is (E) 110.

Q: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 24 (C) 25 (D) 40 (E) 52
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the salesperson's salary, we can start by determining how much commission he earns on each sale. Since he gets a 10% commission on each $250 sale, his commission on each sale would be 10% of $250 which equals $25.

The total number of sales the salesperson needs to make to reach a salary of at least $1000 can be determined by dividing the desired salary by the commission earned per sale:
$1000 ÷ $25 = 40

Therefore, the salesperson must make 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000. So, the correct answer choice is (D) 40.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 40

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate how many sales of $250 each the salesperson must make to reach a salary of at least $1000, we can use the formula:

Total earnings = base salary + commission

Given that the base salary is $1000 and the salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale, we can set up the equation as:

$1000 = Base salary + 10% commission per sale * number of sales * sales amount

$1000 = $1000 + 0.1 * number of sales * $250

Solving for the number of sales:

$1000 = $1000 + 0.1 * number of sales * $250
$1000 = $1000 + 25 * number of sales
25 * number of sales = 0
number of sales = 0

Therefore, the salesperson needs to make 0 sales to reach a salary of at least $1000, which is not possible. This suggests an error in the information provided or the question itself. Let's reassess the problem and correct any misconceptions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The answer is (A) 15.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Here's a breakdown of the problem and step-by-step solution:

1. The salesperson receives a 10% commission on each sale.
2. Let's denote the number of sales required to reach a salary of at least $1000 as "x".
3. Each sale is worth $250.
4. The total earnings from x sales can be calculated as 10% of the total sales made.
5. The total earnings from x sales = 10% * $250 * x.
6. The total earnings from x sales must be at least $1000.
7. So, we can set up the equation: 10% * $250 * x ≥ $1000.

Q: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum selling price per component that will yield the desired yearly profit. Here's how we can break down the steps and the key concepts involved:

1. Calculate the monthly profit from selling 420 units:
   - Revenue from selling 420 units = 420 units * selling price per unit
   - Monthly profit = Revenue - Production cost
   We know that the production cost per component is $110, and the total profit per month needs to be at least $626,400 over the year.

2. Calculate the yearly profit:
   - Yearly profit = Monthly profit * 12 months
   We need the yearly profit to be at least $626,400.

3. Determine the selling price per component:
   - The selling price per component needs to be such that the total yearly revenue (selling price * 420 units per month * 12 months) minus the production costs results in a profit of at least $626,400.

4. Calculate the minimum selling price per component:
   - Minimum selling price = (Total yearly profit + Total yearly production cost) / Total number of units sold in a year
   - Divide this value by 420 to get the minimum selling price per component.

5. Compare the calculated minimum selling price per component with the provided answer choices and select the correct one.

By following these steps and understanding the concepts involved, we can accurately determine the minimum selling price per component to achieve the desired yearly profit.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the minimum selling price per component to guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400.

1. Monthly profit:
   - Production cost per component = $110
   - Yearly production cost = $110 * 420 units * 12 months = $554,400
   - Desired yearly profit = $626,400
   - Monthly profit needed = ($626,400 - $554,400) / 12 = $6,000

2. Selling price per component for monthly profit:
   - Monthly profit = Revenue - Production cost
   - Revenue = Production cost + Monthly profit = $110 + $500 = $6,110

3. Yearly profit:
   - Yearly profit = Monthly profit * 12 months = $6,000 * 12 = $72,000

4. Minimum selling price per component:
   - Total revenue needed for yearly profit = Yearly profit + Yearly production cost = $72,000 + $554,400 = $626,400
   - Minimum selling price per component = $626,400 / (420 units * 12 months) = $120

Given the choices of minimum selling prices per component, the correct answer should be between $110 and $120. However, the provided answer choices do not include a value in that range. It seems there might be a mistake or an oversight in the answer choices provided.

Q: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to calculate the total revenue required to cover the production costs and achieve the desired profit.

1. Monthly production cost: $110 per component
2. Monthly production: 420 units
3. Yearly production cost: $110 * 420 units * 12 months
   = $554,400

To achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400:
Total revenue needed = Yearly production cost + Desired profit
Total revenue needed = $554,400 + $626,400
Total revenue needed = $1,180,800

Since all 420 units are sold each month, the revenue from selling all components in a month is:
Monthly revenue = Selling price per component * Number of units produced and sold
$1,180,800 = Selling price per component * 420 * 12

Now, solve for the selling price per component:
$1,180,800 = Selling price per component * 5040
Selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5040
Selling price per component ≈ $234.29

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $235, which is not one of the answer choices provided.

For other answer choices:
(A) 226 - $226 * 420 * 12 = $1,130,720
(B) 230 - $230 * 420 * 12 = $1,152,720
(C) 240 - $240 * 420 * 12 = $1,176,000
(D) 260 - $260 * 420 * 12 = $1,248,000
(E) 280 - $280 * 420 * 12 = $1,344,000

Among the given answer choices, $240 (C) is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the desired yearly profit.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 240

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the minimum selling price per component needed to achieve the yearly profit goal:

1. Determine monthly production cost:
Given that the company produces 420 units every month at a cost of $110 per unit, the total monthly production cost is:
Total Monthly Production Cost = 420 units * $110/unit = $46,200

2. Determine monthly revenue:
To achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the company's total revenue each month should cover the production costs as well as contribute to the desired profit. The revenue generated from selling the 420 units will be:
Total Monthly Revenue = 420 units * Selling Price per unit

3. Calculate the monthly profit:
The profit obtained by subtracting the production cost from the revenue is:
Monthly Profit = Total Monthly Revenue - Total Monthly Production Cost

4. Calculate the yearly profit:
Since the monthly profit contributes to the yearly profit goal of $626,400, the total yearly profit can be found by multiplying the monthly profit by 12 (representing each month in a year):
Total Yearly Profit = 12 * Monthly Profit

5. Set up the inequality for the yearly profit goal:
To determine the minimum selling price per unit needed for the yearly profit goal, set up the following inequality:
Total Yearly Profit ≥ $626,400

6. Solve for the minimum selling price:
Take into account the monthly production cost and the profit margin required to achieve the yearly profit target to find the minimum selling price per unit.

Let me know if you'd like further guidance on any of these steps or if you'd like to proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To find the minimum selling price per component required to achieve the yearly profit goal of $626,400, we can follow the steps outlined:

1. Calculate the monthly production cost:
Monthly Production Cost = 420 units * $110/unit = $46,200

2. Calculate the monthly profit needed to achieve the yearly profit goal:
Monthly Profit = Total Monthly Revenue - Total Monthly Production Cost
Since the yearly profit goal is $626,400, we need to ensure that the monthly profits contribute to this goal.

3. Calculate the minimum total monthly revenue needed:
Minimum Total Monthly Revenue = Total Monthly Production Cost + Monthly Profit

4. Calculate the minimum selling price per unit to achieve the required monthly revenue:
Selling Price per unit = Minimum Total Monthly Revenue / 420 units

5. Once you determine the selling price per component using the above steps, you can choose the corresponding option from the answer choices provided.

Q: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day? Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's denote the total number of staplers produced on Monday as x.

Next, we can determine the number of defective staplers produced on Monday as 0.10x, since 10 percent of the staplers were defective.

Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday would be 0.90x (100% - 10% defective).

We are told that 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, we can set up an equation:

0.02(0.90x) = 72

Solve the equation to find x:

0.02(0.90x) = 72
0.018x = 72
x = 72 / 0.018
x = 4,000

Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was 4,000. Hence, the correct answer choice is (A) 4,000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 4,000

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Let's denote the total number of staplers produced on Monday as "x".
Step 2: We are given that 10% of the staplers produced were defective. So, the number of defective staplers = 0.10x.
Step 3: This means the number of non-defective staplers produced = x - 0.10x = 0.90x.
Step 4: We are also given that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. So, the number of non-defective staplers rejected = 0.02(0.90x) = 0.018x.
Step 5: We are given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so 0.018x = 72.
Step 6: Solving for x: x = 72 / 0.018 = 4000.
Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day is 4000. 
Therefore, the answer is (A) 4,000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 4,000

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, we can set up equations based on the information given in the question.

Let's denote the total number of staplers produced on Monday as "T," the number of defective staplers as "D," and the number of non-defective staplers as "N."

1. We know that 10% of the staplers produced were defective, so we can write:
D = 0.10T

2. The remaining staplers are non-defective, so N = T - D

3. We are given that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Since 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, we can write:
0.02N = 72

Now, our goal is to find the total number of staplers produced on Monday (T).

Using the above equations, we can substitute for D and N to solve for T:

D = 0.10T
N = T - D

Substitute for D in terms of T into the equation for N:
N = T - 0.10T
N = 0.90T

Now, substitute the value of N into the equation representing the rejected non-defective staplers:
0.02(0.90T) = 72
0.018T = 72
T = 4000

Thus, the number of staplers produced that day (T) is 4,000.

Therefore, the answer choice is (A) 4,000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 4,000

Q: Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine when Machine A and Machine B will have produced 10 yo-yos combined, we first need to find their respective rates of production.

Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so its rate is 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes.
Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so its rate is 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes.

To find the combined rate of production for both machines, we can add their individual rates:
1/6 + 1/9 = 3/18 + 2/18 = 5/18

So, combined, Machines A and B produce 5 yo-yos every 18 minutes.

To find out when they will have produced 10 yo-yos in total, we can set up a proportion:
5 yo-yos / 18 minutes = 10 yo-yos / x minutes

Cross multiplying:
5 * x = 10 * 18
5x = 180
x = 36

Therefore, after 36 minutes, Machines A and B will have produced a total of 10 yo-yos. So, the answer is (C) 36 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 36 minutes

Q: Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can find the time it takes for each machine to produce 1 yo-yo. 

1. Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes. So, in 1 minute, it produces 1/6 of a yo-yo.
2. Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes. So, in 1 minute, it produces 1/9 of a yo-yo.

We want to find out how long it will take both machines to produce a total of 10 yo-yos. Let’s set up equations for both machines:

Let the time taken be x minutes.
For Machine A: (1/6) * x = number of yo-yos produced
For Machine B: (1/9) * x = number of yo-yos produced

Now, we need to find the least common multiple of 6 and 9 to see when they would have produced the same number of yo-yos.

LCM(6, 9) = 18. Therefore, after 18 minutes, they will have produced the same number of yo-yos.

Now, we need to find out how many yo-yos they will have produced in 18 minutes:
For Machine A: (1/6) * 18 = 3 yo-yos
For Machine B: (1/9) * 18 = 2 yo-yos

Therefore, after 18 minutes, they will have produced a total of 5 yo-yos. Since we need to produce 10 yo-yos, we need to figure out how many sets of 10 yo-yos they will produce in 18 minutes.

18 minutes produce 5 yo-yos. 
36 minutes produce 10 yo-yos. 

Therefore, the answer is 36 minutes, which is option (C).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is 36 minutes (C)

Q: Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 9 to determine the time at which both machines will have produced a whole number of yo-yos.

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3, and the prime factorization of 9 is 3 * 3. To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. So, for the LCM of 6 and 9, we have 2 * 3 * 3 = 18.

This means that after 18 minutes, both machines will have produced a whole number of yo-yos. To produce 10 yo-yos, we can see that after 18 minutes, Machine A will produce 10 yo-yos, but Machine B will only produce 6 yo-yos. This indicates that after 18 minutes, Machine A will be the only one to have produced 10 yo-yos.

Therefore, the correct answer is 18 minutes, which is not in the given options.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 64 minutes

First, let's add +45 and -30. When adding positive and negative numbers, we need to consider their signs.

+45 + (-30) = +45 - 30

To subtract 30 from 45, we can add the opposite of 30 to 45:

+45 + (-30) = +45 + (-30) = +45 + (-30) = 45 - 30 = 15

Therefore, +45 + (-30) = +15.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the conditional probability P(A|B), which represents the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred, we can use the formula:

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

Given that A and B are independent events, the probability of both events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

Substitute the given values:
P(A and B) = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16

Now, plug this back into the formula for conditional probability:
P(A|B) = 0.16 / 0.8 = 0.2

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 0.2.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, to find P(A/B), we use the definition of conditional probability:

P(A/B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

Since A and B are independent events, we know that P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting the given probabilities into the formula:

P(A/B) = P(A) * P(B) / P(B)

P(B) cancels out, leaving us with:

P(A/B) = P(A) = 0.2

Therefore, the answer is (A) 0.2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 0.2

Q: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator? Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's denote the speed of the elevator as \( v \) steps per minute.

In the first scenario where walking 20 steps takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom, the total distance traveled can be represented as \( 20 + 20 = 40 \) steps (20 steps down, and 20 steps back up).

So in the first scenario:
- Time taken = Distance/Speed = 40 steps / \( v \) = 10 minutes

Now, in the second scenario where walking 10 steps takes 20 minutes to reach the ground, the total distance traveled is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \) steps (10 steps down, 10 steps back up).

In the second scenario:
- Time taken = Distance/Speed = 20 steps / \( v \) = 20 minutes

Now, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the speed of the elevator (\( v \)):

1. \( \frac{40}{v} = 10 \)  
2. \( \frac{20}{v} = 20 \)

From equation 1, solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{40}{10} = 4 \text{ steps/minute} \]

Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 4 steps per minute. So the correct answer choice is (D) 4 step/minute.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 4 step/minute

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote the speed of the elevator as "x steps/minute". 

For the first scenario where you walk 20 steps and reach the bottom in 10 minutes:
- You walk 20 steps, so the total distance covered is 20 steps.
- Since you reached the bottom in 10 minutes, this means you lose 1 minute for each step compared to the elevator's speed.
- So, for every step you walk, the elevator covers x+1 steps in the same amount of time.
- Therefore, for 20 steps you walk, the elevator covers 20(x+1) steps.
- This 20(x+1) should equal the total distance of 20 steps, so we can write the equation: 20(x+1) = 20.

For the second scenario where you walk 10 steps and reach the ground in 20 minutes:
- Similarly, you lose 2 minutes for each step compared to the elevator's speed.
- So for 10 steps you walk, the elevator covers 10(x+2) steps.
- This 10(x+2) should equal the total distance of 10 steps, so we can write the equation: 10(x+2) = 10.

By solving these two equations, we can find the speed of the elevator and compare it to the given answer choices. Let's proceed with the calculations step by step.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 1 step/minute

Sure, let's break down the problem and identify the key concepts involved:

Let's denote the speed of the elevator as x steps/minute.

For the first scenario where you walk 20 steps and reach the bottom in 10 minutes:
- The time it takes to walk 20 steps is 20/x minutes.
- You also stopped for an additional 10 minutes, so the total time taken is 20/x + 10 minutes.

For the second scenario where you walk 10 steps and reach the ground in 20 minutes:
- The time it takes to walk 10 steps is 10/x minutes.
- You also stopped for an additional 20 minutes, so the total time taken is 10/x + 20 minutes.

Equating the total time taken in both scenarios:
20/x + 10 = 10/x + 20
20/x - 10/x = 20 - 10
10/x = 10
x = 1 step/minute

Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 1 step/minute (Option A).

Q: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold during this period and divide it by 22 months.

Let's first calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year:
Total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months = 20 microwaves/month * 10 months = 200 microwaves

Next, let's calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold last year:
Total number of microwave ovens sold last year = 42 microwaves/month * 12 months = 504 microwaves

Now, let's find the total number of microwave ovens sold during the entire 22 months period:
Total number of microwave ovens sold in 22 months = 200 microwaves (first 10 months) + 504 microwaves (last year) = 704 microwaves

Finally, we can calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period:
Average number of microwave ovens sold per month = Total number of microwaves sold / 22 months = 704 microwaves / 22 months ≈ 32 microwaves

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period is 32. The correct answer is (D) 32.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 32

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we can use the concept of weighted averages since the number of months in each year is different.

The weights are the number of months in each year. The weights for the last year and the first 10 months of this year are 12 and 10, respectively, because there are 12 months in a year.

Let x be the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period. Using the weighted average formula:

(12 * 42 + 10 * 20) / (12 + 10) = 22x

(504 + 200) / 22 = x

704 / 22 = x

x = 32

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 32. So, the answer is (D) 32.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 32

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we can use the formula for the average:

Average = Total quantity / Total number of months

First, let's calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year:

Total quantity for the first 10 months = 20 microwaves/month * 10 months = 200 microwaves

Next, let's calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the previous year:

Total quantity for last year = 42 microwaves/month * 12 months = 504 microwaves

Now, we can calculate the total quantity of microwave ovens sold during the entire 22-month period:

Total quantity = 200 microwaves (from the first 10 months) + 504 microwaves (from last year) = 704 microwaves

Finally, we can find the average number of microwaves sold per month during the entire 22-month period:

Average = 704 microwaves / 22 months = 32 microwaves/month

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 32. Therefore, the answer is (D) 32.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 32

Q: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers? Answer Choices: (A)  (zy – 2x) /z (B)  (zy – 2) /z (C)  (zx – y) / (z – 2)  (D)  (zy – 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy – x) / (z + 2) 
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to calculate the sum of all scores, then subtract the highest and lowest scores from this sum, and finally divided by the total number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers.

Let the highest score be h and the lowest score be l. We are given that the average of the highest and lowest scores is x:
(h + l) / 2 = x
h + l = 2x

We are also given that the average score for the entire class is y:
(sum of all scores) / z = y
sum of all scores = y * z

To find the sum of scores excluding the highest and lowest:
(sum of all scores) - (highest score + lowest score) = sum of all scores excluding highest and lowest
Therefore, (y * z) - (h + l) = sum of all scores excluding highest and lowest
                                            = yz - 2x

Finally, to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we divide the sum of scores excluding the highest and lowest by the number of students excluding the highest and lowest. Since we are excluding 2 students (highest and lowest scorers), the total number of students excluding the highest and lowest is z - 2:
Average score excluding highest and lowest = (yz - 2x) / (z - 2)

So, the correct answer is option (D) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2)

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to consider the average of the highest and lowest scores, the average score for the entire class, and the number of students in the class to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers.

Let's define the following variables:
- Average of highest and lowest scores = x
- Average score for the entire class = y
- Number of students in the class = z
- Sum of all scores in the class = S

We know that the sum of all scores (S) is equal to the total number of students (z) multiplied by the average score for the entire class (y), so S = zy.

Since the average of the highest and lowest scores is x and there are z students in total, the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2xz.

Now, we want to find the sum of all scores in the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. This sum will be S - 2x.

To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we divide the sum of scores excluding the highest and lowest by the number of students excluding the highest and lowest (z - 2):

Average score excluding highest and lowest = (S - 2x) / (z - 2)
Average score excluding highest and lowest = (zy - 2x) / (z - 2)

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (D) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average score for the entire class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to find the total score and the number of students after removing the highest and lowest scores.

Let H be the highest score, L be the lowest score, and A be the sum of all scores in the class.

Given:
1. (H + L) / 2 = x  ⇒  H + L = 2x
2. Average score for the entire class = y  ⇒  A/z = y  ⇒  A = yz

By substituting the value of A, we get:
H + L + A = 2x + yz

Now, for the average score excluding the highest and the lowest scorers:
Average = (A - H - L) / (z - 2)

Substitute the values:
Average = (yz - 2x) / (z - 2) 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2)

Then, we divide the result of the first expression by the result of the second expression and set it equal to 6:
\[\frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13 \times 13 - 156} = 6\]

From here, we can solve for the missing value represented by the question mark and find the answer among the choices provided. Let's go ahead and solve it step by step!

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To find the missing value represented by the question mark in the equation provided, let's solve each part step by step:

Step 1: Solve the expression inside the square brackets:
\[5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7\]

To solve this problem step by step, let's break down the given expression following the order of operations (PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction):

Given expression:
(5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7) / (13 × 13 - 156) = 6

1. Solve the numerator first:
5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7
= 5 + 19? - 15 - 7
= 19? - 17

2. Solve the denominator:

   This simplifies to: 5 + 19? - 15 - 7

2. Next, solve the remaining bracketed expression: 13 × 13 - 156
   This simplifies to: 169 - 156 = 13

3. Substituting the values back into the original equation, we get: (5 + 19? - 15 - 7) / 13 = 6

4. Solve for ?:
   Combine like terms: 5 - 15 - 7 = -17
   Simplify the equation: (19? - 17) / 13 = 6
   Multiply both sides by 13 to get rid of the denominator: 19? - 17 = 78
   Add 17 to both sides to isolate the term with the unknown: 19? = 95
   Divide by 19 to solve for ? and get: ? = 95 / 19 = 5

Therefore, the value of ? is 5, matching answer choice (C) 5.

Q: A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for calculating profit based on selling price and percentage profit.

Let's denote the cost price of each bag of flour as CP, the selling price as SP, and the profit as P. We are given that the profit percentage is 25% and the selling price is $100. Therefore, the profit made on each bag is 25% of $100, which is $25.

We are also given that the total profit made by selling a certain number of bags is $3,000. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

$25 (profit per bag) x (number of bags) = $3,000

This simplifies to:

25x = 3000

To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 25:

x = 3000 / 25
x = 120

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour. Let's check if 120 bags is listed among the answer choices given.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 30

Q: A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of bags the grocer sold, we can set up an equation.

The profit made on each bag is 25% of the selling price, so the profit per bag is $100 * 0.25 = $25.

If the total profit made was $3,000, we can divide the total profit by the profit made per bag to find the number of bags sold:
$3,000 / $25 = 120 bags

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags to make a profit of $3,000.

However, the answer choices provided contain fewer bags, so let's reevaluate the information given in the question to see if there was an error.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 12. 

Let's calculate the number of bags sold again using the given information:

Profit per bag = $100 * 25% = $25
Total profit = $3,000

Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $3,000 / $25
Number of bags sold = 120

Q: A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of bags the grocer sold, we need to use the information given in the problem.

Let x be the cost price of each bag of flour.

The selling price is $100 per bag, and the profit is 25% of the selling price. This means the profit per bag is 25% of $100, which is $25.

Since the profit from selling each bag is $25 and the total profit is $3,000, we can set up the equation:

$25 profit per bag * number of bags sold = $3,000 total profit
$25x = $3,000

Now, solve for x:

x = $3,000 / $25
x = 120

Therefore, the cost price of each bag is $120.

To find the number of bags sold, we can divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $3,000 / $25
Number of bags sold = 120 bags

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour. So, the correct answer is not among the provided choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Not provided, but the correct answer is that the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.

Q: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let x be the number of toys made by Alex and y be the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the information given:
1. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy.
2. During a month, both Alex and Jacob make 35 toys in total: x + y = 35.
3. Both Alex and Jacob have worked for almost similar number of hours: Alex takes 7x hours, and Jacob takes 9y hours.

Since both Alex and Jacob make the same number of toys in a month, we have the equation:
7x = 9y.

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. x + y = 35
2. 7x = 9y

To find the number of toys made by Jacob (y), we can solve this system of equations. Let's solve the system using substitution or elimination method to find the value of y, which represents the number of toys made by Jacob.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To solve the system of equations given:
1. x + y = 35
2. 7x = 9y

Let's use the second equation to express y in terms of x:
y = (7/9)x

Substitute this expression for y into the first equation:
x + (7/9)x = 35
(16/9)x = 35
x = (35 * 9) / 16
x = 19.6875

Since x represents the number of toys made by Alex, it cannot be a fraction. This indicates that there might be some issue with the initial setup or information provided in the question. Let's reevaluate the problem and verify the calculations to determine the correct approach.

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps to solve it:

Step 1: Calculate how much work each of them can do in 1 hour.
- Alex can make 1 toy in 7 hours, so in 1 hour, Alex can make 1/7 of a toy.
- Jacob can make 1 toy in 9 hours, so in 1 hour, Jacob can make 1/9 of a toy.

Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information.
Let A represent the number of toys Alex made and J represent the number of toys Jacob made.
From the problem, we know:
A + J = 35 (total number of toys made)
Also, since they have worked for almost an equal number of hours:
A * 7 = J * 9

Step 3: Solve the equations.
Since A * 7 = J * 9, we can substitute A with 35 - J in the equation:
(35 - J) * 7 = J * 9
Expanding this equation, we get:
245 - 7J = 9J
Combining like terms, we get:
245 = 16J
Dividing by 16 on both sides, we get:
J = 15.3125

Step 4: Determine the nearest whole number of toys prepared by Jacob.
Since we cannot have a fraction of a toy, Jacob must have prepared 15 toys (rounded down from 15.3125).

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 15 toys have been prepared by Jacob.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 15

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of toys Jacob made, we can first determine how many toys each person makes in one hour.

Alex makes 1 toy in 7 hours, so Alex makes 1/7 toys per hour.
Jacob makes 1 toy in 9 hours, so Jacob makes 1/9 toys per hour.

Since both Alex and Jacob together made 35 toys in total and have worked for an almost similar number of hours, we can set up the following equation:
(1/7)x + (1/9)x = 35

Now, we can solve for x, which is the number of hours worked by both Alex and Jacob:
(9/63)x + (7/63)x = 35
(16/63)x = 35
x = (35 * 63)/16
x = 138.75 hours

Since Alex and Jacob together worked for 138.75 hours each, we can find the number of toys made by Jacob:
(1/9) * 138.75 = 15.42

Therefore, Jacob made approximately 15 toys. Thus, the answer is (A) 15.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 15

Q: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the tea is 50% strong.
2. John replaces 15% of this 50% tea with milk twice. This means the remaining tea content after each replacement is 85% of the previous content.
3. After the first replacement, the remaining tea content is 85% of 50% = 0.85 * 50% = 42.5%.
4. After the second replacement, the remaining tea content is 85% of 42.5% = 0.85 * 42.5% = 36.125%.
5. Finally, John replaces 10% of this 36.125% solution with more milk. This means the remaining tea content is 90% of the previous content.
6. After the final replacement, the remaining tea content is 90% of 36.125% = 0.9 * 36.125% = 32.513%.

Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is approximately 32.51%, which matches answer choice (E).

Q: In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
1. Calculate the number of students studying math:
1/16 of the total students study math.
Therefore, the fraction can be represented as (1/16)*x, where x is the total number of students.

2. Calculate the number of students studying bio:
1/10 of the total students study bio.
The fraction can be represented as (1/10)*x.

3. Calculate the number of students studying English:
1/8 of the total students study English.
The fraction can be represented as (1/8)*x.

4. To find the total number of students:
Total students = (1/16)*x + (1/10)*x + (1/8)*x

5. The total number of students should be a 4-digit number:
Let's assume the total number of students is a 4-digit number between 1000 and 9999.
We will calculate total students for potential values from 1000 to 9999 until we find a solution that satisfies the given conditions.

6. Once we find the minimum and maximum values for the total number of students, we can calculate the difference between them to determine the answer.

Let's start calculating the total number of students for different values within the 4-digit range to find the minimum and maximum values for the total number of students.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 7890.

Q: In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the minimum and maximum number of students, we need to consider the least and greatest possible values for the total number of students.

Let's start by breaking down the information given:
- 1/16 of the students study math
- 1/10 of the students study bio
- 1/8 of the students study English

To find the minimum total number of students, we can assume that all the fractions are rounded up to the nearest whole number. This is because the total number of students must be a whole number.

Minimum number of students:
Math: 1/16 = 1 student
Bio: 1/10 = 1 student
English: 1/8 = 1 student

Total minimum = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 students

Next, to find the maximum total number of students, we assume all the fractions are rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Maximum number of students:
Math: 1/16 = 0 students
Bio: 1/10 = 0 students
English: 1/8 = 0 students

Total maximum = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 students

Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:
0 - 3 = -3 students

However, since the total number of students must be a 4-digit number, we need to consider that. This means the total number of students is at least 1000 and at most 9999.

To correct our calculations for the minimum and maximum number of students:
Minimum number of students: 1000 (since 3 students cannot be the total number)
Maximum number of students: 9999 (since 0 students cannot be the total number)

Now, we can find the difference:
9999 - 1000 = 8999

So, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 8999.

The closest answer choice is (C) 8890.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 8890

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 16, 10, and 8 to determine the total number of students.

The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is 80. This means the total number of students is a multiple of 80.

Next, we calculate the number of students studying each subject:
- Math: 1/16 x 80 = 5 students
- Bio: 1/10 x 80 = 8 students
- English: 1/8 x 80 = 10 students

The total number of students studying these subjects is 5 + 8 + 10 = 23 students.

Therefore, the minimum total number of students is 80 while the maximum total number of students is the next multiple of 80, which is 160.

The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 160 - 80 = 80.

Thus, the answer is (A) 8880.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 8880

Round to the nearest hundredth. Answer Choices: (A) 2 miles (B) 2.25 miles (C) 3.25 miles (D) 3.85 miles (E) 2.85 miles
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, first, we need to determine Bill's speed on a windy day. Since his average speed is 15 mph and his speed is reduced by 4 mph on a windy day, his speed on a windy day would be 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Next, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours (since speed is given in miles per hour). There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

Now, we will use the formula distance = speed x time to calculate how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes:
distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, Bill can travel 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes. Rounding to the nearest hundredth gives us 3.85 miles, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Bill's speed on a windy day: Since his normal speed is 15 mph and the windy day reduces it by 4 mph, his speed on a windy day is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph.

2. Convert the time given in the problem to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is equal to 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

3. Use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time to calculate the distance Bill can travel on a windy day. Distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

Therefore, Bill can travel 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes, rounded to the nearest hundredth, which matches answer choice (D) 3.85 miles.

Q: A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance? Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the given information.

Let's denote the cost of the appliance as "C" and the selling price as "S". Since the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, the selling price can be represented as 1.4 times the cost:

S = 1.4C

Given that the gross profit is $20, we can express the gross profit as the difference between the selling price and the cost:

S - C = $20

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:

1.4C - C = $20
0.4C = $20
C = $20 / 0.4
C = $50

Now, we can calculate the selling price using the first equation:

S = 1.4($50)
S = $70

Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $70. Hence, the correct answer choice is (D) $70.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $70.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can break it down as follows:
Let's denote the cost of the appliance as "C".
The retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost, so the selling price can be calculated as:
Selling price = Cost + 40% of Cost
Selling price = C + 0.4C
Selling price = 1.4C

Given that the gross profit from selling the appliance was $20.00, we can set up the equation:
Selling price - Cost = Gross profit
1.4C - C = $20.00
0.4C = $20.00
C = $20.00 / 0.4
C = $50.00

So the cost of the appliance was $50.00, and the selling price is 1.4 times the cost:
Selling price = 1.4 * $50.00
Selling price = $70.00

Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $70.00. The correct answer choice is (D) $70.00.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $70.00

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's denote the cost of the appliance as "C" (the retailer's purchase price).
2. The retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost, meaning the selling price is 100% (cost) + 40% (markup) = 140% of the cost.
3. The gross profit made by the retailer is given as $20.
4. The selling price can be calculated using the formula: Selling Price = Cost + Gross Profit.
5. We know that the gross profit is $20, so we can represent it as 0.40C = $20 (since 40% of the cost gives the profit).
6. Solving for C, we find that C = $50.
7. Therefore, the selling price of the appliance is 140% of the cost, which is 1.40 * $50 = $70.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) $70.00.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $70.00

Q: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Okay, to calculate the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years at 6% per annum simple interest, we first need to determine the interest amount.

Simple Interest (SI) can be calculated using the formula:

SI = P * r * t

Where:
P = Principal amount borrowed (Rs. 500 in this case)
r = Rate of interest per annum (6% or 0.06)
t = Time period in years (4 years in this case)

Now, plug in the values to find the Simple Interest:

SI = 500 * 0.06 * 4
SI = 120

Next, the total amount Rahul will pay is the sum of the principal amount borrowed and the interest accrued:

Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest
Total Amount = 500 + 120
Total Amount = 620

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 620.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 620

Q: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for calculating simple interest:

Simple Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

Given:
Principal (P) = Rs. 500
Rate (R) = 6% per annum or 0.06
Time (T) = 4 years

Let's substitute these values into the formula:

Simple Interest = 500 x 0.06 x 4
Simple Interest = 120

The total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years is the sum of the principal amount and the simple interest:

Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest
Total Amount = 500 + 120
Total Amount = 620

Therefore, Rahul will pay Rs. 620 to clear the debt after 4 years. The correct answer choice is (C) 620.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 620

Q: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years Answer Choices: (A) 750 (B) 700 (C) 620 (D) 600 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To calculate the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years with a 6% per annum simple interest rate, we need to apply the formula for simple interest:

Simple Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

Given:
Principal = Rs. 500
Rate = 6% per annum
Time = 4 years

First, calculate the total interest accrued over 4 years:
Simple Interest = 500 x 0.06 x 4
Simple Interest = 120

Now, add the total interest to the principal to find the total amount Rahul will pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest
Total Amount = Rs. 500 + Rs. 120
Total Amount = Rs. 620

Therefore, Rahul will pay Rs. 620 to clear the debt after 4 years. So, the correct answer is (C) 620.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 620

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine which pair does not satisfy the routine, we need to follow the rules given in the problem carefully. 

For each pair, we calculate the square root of the first number and check if the second number is less than or equal to the square root of the first number.

Let's evaluate each pair:
(A) (99,10): The square root of 99 is approximately 9.95, so 10 is less than or equal to the square root of 99. This pair satisfies the routine.

(B) (85,9): The square root of 85 is approximately 9.22, so 9 is less than or equal to the square root of 85. This pair satisfies the routine.

(C) (50,7): The square root of 50 is approximately 7.07, so 7 is less than or equal to the square root of 50. This pair satisfies the routine.

(D) (1,1): The square root of 1 is 1, so 1 is equal to the square root of 1. This pair satisfies the routine.

(E) (1,0): The square root of 1 is 1, so 0 is not less than or equal to the square root of 1. This pair does not satisfy the routine.

Therefore, the pair (1,0) does not satisfy the routine, and the answer should be (E) (1,0).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) (1,0)

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To identify which pair does not satisfy the routine, let's break down the process:

1. The first number (x) is a random number between 0 and 100, inclusive.
2. The second number (y) must be less than or equal to the square root of the first number.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

(A) (99, 10):
- In this case, x = 99 and y = 10. The square root of 99 is approximately 9.95, which means y is less than the square root of x. So, this pair satisfies the routine.

(B) (85, 9):
- For x = 85, the square root of 85 is approximately 9.22. Since y is less than or equal to 9 and 9 is less than 9.22, this pair also satisfies the routine.

(C) (50, 7):
- For x = 50, the square root of 50 is approximately 7.07. Here, y = 7, which is less than or equal to 7.07. Therefore, this pair satisfies the routine.

(D) (1, 1):
- For x = 1, the square root of 1 is 1. Since y = 1, which is less than or equal to the square root of x (1), this pair also satisfies the routine.

(E) (1, 0):
- For x = 1, the square root of 1 is 1. In this case, y = 0, which is also less than or equal to the square root of 1. So, this pair satisfies the routine.

After analyzing all answer choices, we can see that all of them satisfy the conditions of the routine. There does not appear to be a pair that does not meet the given criteria based on the information provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is that there is no pair that does not satisfy the routine as described. All the provided pairs [(99, 10), (85, 9), (50, 7), (1, 1), (1, 0)] meet the specified conditions of the routine.

Q: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first denote the speed of the jeep on the forward journey as \(S\) km/hr and the distance traveled as \(D\) km.

Given that the time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours, we can write the equation for the forward journey as: 
\[D = S \times 6\]

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed during the return journey is \(S + 12\) km/hr. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, so we can write the equation for the return journey as: 
\[D = (S + 12) \times 4\]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \(D = 6S\)
2. \(D = 4(S + 12)\)

From the above equations, we can equate the expressions for \(D\):
\[6S = 4(S + 12)\]

Solve for \(S\):
\[6S = 4S + 48\]
\[2S = 48\]
\[S = 24\]

Substitute \(S = 24\) back into the equation for the forward journey:
\[D = 6 \times 24\]
\[D = 144\]

Therefore, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km. So, the answer is (B) 144km.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 144km

Q: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the information given:

Let the speed of the jeep for the forward journey be x km/hr.
The distance travelled by the jeep is the same for both the forward and return journeys.

First, let's set up the equation for the forward journey:
Distance = Speed * Time
D = x * 6 hours
D = 6x

Now, let's set up the equation for the return journey using the increased speed:
Return speed = x + 12 km/hr
Return time = 4 hours
D = (x + 12) * 4

Since the distance is the same for both journeys, we can set the equations equal to each other:
6x = 4(x + 12)

Solving the equation:
6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24

Now that we have the speed for the forward journey, we can calculate the distance travelled by the jeep:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 24 km/hr * 6 hours
Distance = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km. So, the answer choice is (B) 144 km.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 144km

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the initial speed of the jeep be x km/hr. During the forward journey:
   - Time taken = 6 hours
   - Distance = 6x km

2. During the return journey, the speed increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes (x + 12) km/hr. The time taken is 4 hours.
   - Distance = 4(x + 12) km

3. Since the distance is the same for both the forward and return journeys:
   6x = 4(x + 12)

4. Simplifying the equation:
   6x = 4x + 48
   2x = 48
   x = 24

5. Substituting x back into the distance formula for the forward journey:
   Distance = 6x = 6(24) = 144 km

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km. So the correct answer choice is (B) 144km.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 144km

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
When you were 2 years old, your brother was half your age, which means he was 1 year younger than you. Therefore, your brother is 59 years old now.

Explanation:
When you were 2 years old, your brother would have been 2 - 1 = 1 year old.
Now you are 60 years old, and your brother is 60 - 1 = 59 years old.
So, the answer is (A) 59.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
When you were 2 years old, your brother was half your age, which means he was 1 year younger than you at that time. So when you were 2, your brother was 1 year old.

Now you are 60 years old, which means there's a 59-year age gap between you and your brother.

Therefore, if your brother was 1 year old when you were 2, he is now 60 + 1 = 61 years old. 

So your brother is 61 years old. Since this option is not among the provided answer choices, we need to do a recalculation. The most likely scenario is that the age range applies only for the current age. 

If you are 60 years old now and your brother was half your age when you were 2, it means he was 1 year younger than you. So, your brother would be 60 - 1 = 59 years old now.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A) 59.

Q: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100.
1. The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. So, the original retail price = $100 + 60% of $100 = $100 + $60 = $160.

2. The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So, the selling price = $160 - 20% of $160 = $160 - $32 = $128.

3. Now, let's calculate the percentage more than the wholesale cost that the appliance was sold for:
Percentage more than wholesale cost = [(Selling Price - Wholesale Cost) / Wholesale Cost] * 100
= [($128 - $100) / $100] * 100
= ($28 / $100) * 100
= 28%

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (B) 28%.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let W be the wholesale cost of the appliance.
2. The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, so it is 1.6 times the wholesale cost: 1.6W.
3. The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means it was sold for 80% of the original price: 0.8 * 1.6W = 1.28W.

To find out how much the appliance was sold for as a percentage of the wholesale cost, we need to calculate the difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost, and then express that as a percentage increase over the wholesale cost.

The difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost is: 1.28W - W = 0.28W.

To express this as a percentage increase over the wholesale cost, we divide the difference by the wholesale cost and multiply by 100:

(0.28W / W) * 100 = 28%

Therefore, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost. The correct answer choice is (B) 28%.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the wholesale cost of the appliance is represented by the value "C".
2. The original retail price of the appliance is 60% more than the wholesale cost, so it would be \(C + 0.6C = 1.6C\).
3. The appliance was actually sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means it was sold for \(1.6C - 0.2(1.6C) = 1.6C - 0.32C = 1.28C\).
4. To find out how much more this selling price is compared to the wholesale cost, we need to calculate the difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost, divided by the wholesale cost, and then express that as a percentage:
   \(\frac{1.28C - C}{C} = \frac{0.28C}{C} = 0.28 = 28%\)

Therefore, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, we should first determine the scale of the map.

Given that 1/4 inch on the map represents 10 miles in real life, we can set up a proportion to find the scale:
1/4 inch on map = 10 miles in reality

Let x represent the actual distance from Town F to Town G in miles.
So, we can set up the proportion:
1/4 inch = 10 miles
20 inches = x miles

Cross-multiplying, we get:
1 * x = 4 * 10
x = 40

This means that the actual distance from Town F to Town G is 40 miles. 
Therefore, the correct answer choice is not given among the options provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices provided match the correct answer, which is 40 miles. It seems there may have been a mistake in the options presented.

Since 1/4 inch on the map represents 10 miles in actual distance:
1 inch on the map represents 10 miles * 4 = 40 miles.
This means that the scale of the map is 1 inch = 40 miles.

2. Find the actual distance between Town F and Town G on the map:
As the distance on the map from Town F to Town G is 20 inches,
Actual distance = 20 inches * 40 miles/inch = 800 miles.

Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 800 miles.
The answer is (A) 800.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 800

Q: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's denote the length and width of the rectangular sheet as \( L \) and \( W \) respectively.

When folded into two equal halves along the length, each part will have a perimeter of 48 cm. This means that the length of each part is \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) cm and the width remains \(W\). So, we have:
\[ 24 + 24 + W + W = 48 \]
\[ 48 + 2W = 48 \]
\[ 2W = 24 \]
\[ W = 12 \]
So, the original length of the rectangle, \( L \), is equal to \(24\).

Next, when folded along the width, each part now has a perimeter of 66 cm. So, the new dimensions are \(L\) (length now acts as the width of the folded sheet) and \(\frac{66-24-24}{2} = 9\) cm for each part's length. Therefore:
\[ 24 + 9 + L + L = 66 \]
\[ 2L + 33 = 66 \]
\[ 2L = 33 \]
\[ L = 16.5 \]

Now we have the dimensions of the original sheet, \(L = 24\) cm and \(W = 12\) cm. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times W = 24 \times 12 = 288 \ \text{cm}^2 \). 

Therefore, the correct answer choice is not among the options given.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the provided answer choices seem to be correct based on the calculations. To find the correct area of the sheet, let's calculate it based on the given dimensions of the rectangle.

The original length of the rectangle is \(24\) cm, and the width is \(12\) cm. Thus, the area of the rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 24 \times 12 = 288 \ \text{cm}^2 \]

However, the correct answer choice is not among the options provided.

Q: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, you need to understand the relationship between the perimeter and the dimensions of the rectangle when it's folded along different sets of sides.

Let's denote the dimensions of the original rectangle as length (L) and width (W).

When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. Since we're folding it along the length, the width of each part becomes W/2. Therefore, the equation becomes:

2(L/2) + 2W = 48.

Simplifying this, we get:
L + 2W = 48.

Similarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This time, the length of each part becomes L/2. So, the equation becomes:

2L + 2(W/2) = 66.

Simplifying this, we get:
2L + W = 66.

Now, you have two equations:

1. L + 2W = 48
2. 2L + W = 66

Solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of L and W. Then, calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula Area = Length x Width.

Take your time to solve the equations carefully, and once you find the values of L and W, calculate the area. Let me know if you need any further assistance with the calculations or have any questions along the way!

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the system of equations to find the dimensions of the rectangle.

Equation 1: L + 2W = 48
Equation 2: 2L + W = 66

To solve for L and W, we can use various methods such as substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method here.

Multiply Equation 1 by 2:
2(L + 2W) = 2(48)
2L + 4W = 96

Subtract Equation 2 from the modified Equation 1:
(2L + 4W) - (2L + W) = 96 - 66
3W = 30
W = 10 cm

Now substitute the value of W back into Equation 1:
L + 2(10) = 48
L + 20 = 48
L = 28 cm

Therefore, the dimensions of the original rectangle are L = 28 cm and W = 10 cm.

Finally, calculate the area of the rectangle:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 28 cm x 10 cm
Area = 280 cm²

Hence, the area of the rectangle is 280 cm², which is NOT among the given answer choices. Let's recheck the calculations or details provided in the question to ensure accuracy.

Q: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
1. **Understanding the problem:** The problem describes a rectangular sheet that can be folded into two equal halves in two different ways. The perimeter changes depending on how it is folded. We need to find the area of the original sheet.

2. **Identifying key information:** 
   - Perimeter when folded along one set of sides = 48cm for each part
   - Perimeter when folded along the other set of sides = 66cm for each part

3. **Step-by-step solution:**
   - Let's denote the original dimensions of the rectangular sheet as length = L and width = W.
   - When folded along the length, the new dimensions become L/2 and W*2, and the total perimeter is 48cm. So, we have: 2(L/2 + W) = 48. Simplifying gives L + 2W = 48. (Equation 1)
   - When folded along the width, the new dimensions become L*2 and W/2, and the total perimeter is 66cm. So, we have: 2(L + W/2) = 66. Simplifying gives 2L + W = 66. (Equation 2)
   - Now, we have a system of equations (Equation 1 and Equation 2) that we can solve simultaneously to find L and W.
   - Solve Equation 1 and Equation 2 to get L = 24 and W = 12.
   - The area of the original sheet is A = L * W = 24 * 12 = 288 square cm.

4. **Final answer:** The correct area of the sheet is 288 square cm, which is not listed among the provided answer choices. Therefore, please recheck the problem or provide additional information if needed.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is While the previous explanation contained an error, let's correct it here.

Given:
- Perimeter when folded along one set of sides = 48cm for each part
- Perimeter when folded along the other set of sides = 66cm for each part

Let's denote the length of the rectangular sheet as L and the width as W.

- When the sheet is folded along the length:
  - Two equal parts: L/2 and W
  - Perimeter = 2(L/2 + W) = 48
  - Simplifying gives: L + 2W = 48 ... (Equation 1)

- When the sheet is folded along the width:
  - Two equal parts: L and W/2
  - Perimeter = 2(L + W/2) = 66
  - Simplifying gives: 2L + W = 66 ... (Equation 2)

Now, solve equations (1) and (2) simultaneously to find L and W:
From Equation 1: L = 48 - 2W
Substitute into Equation 2:
2(48 - 2W) + W = 66
96 - 4W + W = 66
96 - 3W = 66
3W = 30
W = 10

Now, substitute W = 10 back into L = 48 - 2W:
L = 48 - 2(10)
L = 48 - 20
L = 28

The area A of the sheet is A = L * W = 28 * 10 = 280 square cm, which is closest to the answer choice (C) 792.

Q: A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere? Answer Choices: (A)  13.3542 (B)  15.8113 (C)  18.3451 (D)  19.5667 (E)  20.8888
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the diameter of the sphere, we first need to find the diagonal of the rectangular solid, as it will be the diameter of the sphere.

The diagonal of a rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's denote the sides of the rectangular solid as follows:
- length (l) = 15
- width (w) = 4
- height (h) = 3

The diagonal (d) of the rectangular solid can be found using the formula:
d = √(l² + w² + h²)

Substitute the given values into the formula:
d = √(15² + 4² + 3²)
d = √(225 + 16 + 9)
d = √250
d ≈ 15.8114

Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is approximately 15.8114, which is closest to the answer choice (B) 15.8113.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 15.8113

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can start by determining the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid, which is the diameter of the sphere. 

The longest diagonal of a rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. For a rectangular solid with dimensions 3 x 4 x 15, the longest diagonal can be calculated as follows:

Length of longest diagonal = √(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2)
                            = √(9 + 16 + 225)
                            = √250
                            = 15.8114 (approximately)

Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is approximately 15.8114.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 15.8113

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the diameter of the sphere inscribed in the rectangular solid, we need to determine the distance from one corner of the rectangular solid to its opposite corner through the center of the sphere. 

This distance can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem twice, once for the length diagonally across the bottom face of the solid and once for the height of the solid. 

1. Diagonal across the bottom face: 
   Using the Pythagorean Theorem:
   \(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25\)
   \(√25 = 5\)

2. Height of the solid:
   Using the Pythagorean Theorem:
   \(5^2 + 15^2 = 25 + 225 = 250\)
   \(√250 ≈ 15.8114\)

Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is twice the height, which is approximately 2 * 15.8114 = 31.6228.
Hence, the correct answer choice is not among the ones provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Not provided. The correct diameter of the sphere inscribed in the rectangular solid is approximately 31.6228 units.

Q: A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home? Answer Choices: (A) 3km (B) 2km (C) 4km (D) 5km (E) 6km
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to visualize the movements of A on a coordinate plane. Let's break down the movements step by step:

1. A starts traveling 3 km south. This means A moves down on the coordinate plane by 3 units.
2. A then travels 5 km east. This means A moves to the right on the coordinate plane by 5 units.
3. A then travels 3 km north. This means A moves up on the coordinate plane by 3 units.
4. Finally, A travels 2 km west. This means A moves to the left on the coordinate plane by 2 units.

Now, let's calculate the final position of A on the coordinate plane:
- A moved 3 units down and then moved 3 units up, so A's vertical position didn't change.
- A moved 5 units to the right and then 2 units to the left, so A's horizontal position changed by 5 - 2 = 3 units to the right.

Therefore, A is 3 km to the east from its starting point. So, the correct answer is (A) 3km.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 3km

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine how far A is from home in the end, we need to analyze the movements made in each direction and incorporate the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance.

1. South 3km: This movement doesn't contribute to the final distance from home as it cancels out the northward movement in the end.
2. East 5km: This adds to the distance along the x-axis.
3. North 3km: This cancels out 3km of the initial southward movement and doesn't add to the final distance from home.
4. West 2km: This subtracts from the total distance along the x-axis.

Calculating the net movement along the x-axis: 5km (east) - 2km (west) = 3km east.

Now, we need to find the distance from home using the Pythagorean theorem. The distance from home will be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 3km and 3km.

Distance from home = sqrt((3km)^2 + (3km)^2) = sqrt(9 + 9) = sqrt(18) ≈ 4.24 km.

Therefore, A is approximately 4km from home in the end. The correct answer choice is (C) 4km.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 4km

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the final distance of A from home, we can break down the movements as follows:

1. A travels 3 km south.
2. A then travels 5 km east, which is perpendicular to the southward movement.
3. A then travels 3 km north, which is opposite to the initial southward movement.
4. Finally, A travels 2 km west, which is perpendicular to both the eastward and northward movements.

To simplify the directions:
Southward and northward movements cancel each other out, so we don't need to consider them.
Eastward and westward movements are perpendicular and will contribute to the final displacement.

Therefore, the net displacement of A's movements is the distance between the final eastward and westward points. Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
Distance = √((5km)² + (2km)²)
Distance = √(25 + 4)
Distance = √29
Distance ≈ 5.39 km

So, the closest answer choice to the final distance of A from home would be (D) 5 km.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 5km

Q: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 697.50 (B) Rs. 712.50 (C) Rs. 787.50 (D) Rs. 750 (E) Rs. 780
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's denote the marked price of the watch as M.

According to the given condition:
When the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he earns a certain profit.
Selling price at 5% discount = M - 0.05M = 0.95M
Let the profit earned in this case be P1.

When the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit.
Selling price at 7% discount = M - 0.07M = 0.93M
Profit earned in this case = P1 - 15

Now, we can form two equations:
1) P1 = 0.95M - Cost Price
2) P1 - 15 = 0.93M - Cost Price

By solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the value of the marked price M. Let's proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the equations to determine the marked price of the watch:

Equation 1: P1 = 0.95M - Cost Price
Equation 2: P1 - 15 = 0.93M - Cost Price

From Equation 1 and Equation 2, we can deduce:
0.95M - Cost Price = P1
0.93M - Cost Price = P1 - 15

Substitute the value of P1 from the first equation into the second equation:
0.93M - 0.95M + Cost Price = P1 - 15
-0.02M + Cost Price = P1 - 15

Since both P1 expressions are the same, we can equate the right-hand sides of the equations:
0.95M - Cost Price - 15 = -0.02M + Cost Price

Rearrange the equation and solve for M:
0.95M + 0.02M = 2 * Cost Price + 15
0.97M = 2 * Cost Price + 15
M = (2 * Cost Price + 15) / 0.97

Now, we can proceed to find the marked price of the watch by substituting the given values and calculating the result.

After solving the above mathematical expression, we will be able to determine the marked price of the watch with the given conditions. Let's continue the calculations to arrive at the final answer.
=========== 2-th CoT ============
Q: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 697.50 (B) Rs. 712.50 (C) Rs. 787.50 (D) Rs. 750 (E) Rs. 780
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first denote the marked price of the watch as M. 

Given that when a 5% discount is applied, the profit earned by the shopkeeper is reduced by Rs. 15. This means that the 5% discount equals Rs. 15. So, 5% of M is equal to Rs. 15.

Mathematically, we can represent this as:
0.05M = 15

Solving for M:
M = 15 / 0.05
M = Rs. 300

Now, with the marked price being Rs. 300, let's calculate the profit if a 7% discount is applied. This time, the profit is Rs. 15 less than when a 5% discount is applied. 

Let P1 be the profit earned with a 5% discount and P2 be the profit earned with a 7% discount.

So, P1 - P2 = 15

Now, we can use the formula for profit:
P1 = M - 0.05M
P2 = M - 0.07M

Substitute in the formula:
(M - 0.05M) - (M - 0.07M) = 15
0.02M = 15
M = 15 / 0.02
M = Rs. 750

Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Rs. 750, which corresponds to option (D).

Q: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 697.50 (B) Rs. 712.50 (C) Rs. 787.50 (D) Rs. 750 (E) Rs. 780
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's denote the marked price of the watch as M.

According to the given information:
1. Selling price with a 5% discount is 95% of the marked price (M).
2. Selling price with a 7% discount is 93% of the marked price (M).

Now, we are given that if the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount instead of a 5% discount, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. This means that the difference in profit between the two discount scenarios is Rs. 15.

To find out this profit difference in terms of percentages, we can calculate it as follows:
Profit with 5% discount = 95% of the marked price - cost price
Profit with 7% discount = 93% of the marked price - cost price

Given that the difference in profit is Rs. 15:
(95% of M - cost price) - (93% of M - cost price) = Rs. 15
Simplify:
2% of M = Rs. 15
Now, find the value of 2% of M:
0.02M = 15
M = 15 / 0.02
M = Rs. 750

Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750, which matches option (D).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) Rs. 750

Q: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the number we're looking for be "x".

The student found the value of 7/18 of the number, instead of 7/8. So, the student calculated 7/18 * x.

The actual value the student should have found is 7/8 * x.

We know that the difference between the two calculated values is 770. Mathematically, we can express this as:

7/8 * x - 7/18 * x = 770

To solve this equation and find the value of x, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side. The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72. So, we multiply each fraction by the necessary factor to make the denominators common:

(7/8) * x * 9/9 - (7/18) * x * 4/4 = 770
63x/72 - 28x/72 = 770

Now we can combine the fractions:

(63x - 28x) / 72 = 770
35x / 72 = 770

Now, solve for x:

35x = 770 * 72
35x = 55440
x = 55440 / 35
x = 1584

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1584.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 1584

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up and solve an equation based on the given information.

Let the number be x.

The student found the value of 7/18 of the number, so the student's calculation is (7/18)*x.

The student's answer differed from the actual one by 770, so we can set up the equation:

(7/18)*x + 770 = (7/8)*x

Now, we solve for x:

Multiply through by 144 to clear the fractions:

(7*8)*x + 770*144 = (7*18)*x
56x + 110880 = 126x
110880 = 70x
x = 110880 / 70
x = 1584

Therefore, the number is 1584.

So the correct answer choice is (A) 1584.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 1584

Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let the number be x.
7/8 of the number = 7x/8
7/18 of the number = 7x/18

Given that the student found the value of 7/18 of the number instead of 7/8 of the number. So, the difference between the two calculations is 770:
(7x/8) - (7x/18) = 770

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of x:

Multiply the entire equation by 72 to get rid of the fractions:
72*(7x/8) - 72*(7x/18) = 72*770
63x - 28x = 55440
35x = 55440
x = 55440 / 35
x = 1584

Therefore, the number is 1584. So, the answer choice is (A) 1584.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 1584

Q: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? Answer Choices: (A) $50000 (B) $40000 (C) $30000 (D) $20000 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's set up the equation based on the given information.

The monthly salary S can be expressed as:
S = $500 (fixed salary) + 0.05 x (monthly sales)

Given that the total monthly salary S should reach $1500, we have:
$1500 = $500 + 0.05 x (monthly sales)

Now, let's solve for the monthly sales:
$1000 = 0.05 x (monthly sales)
Dividing both sides by 0.05:
$1000 / 0.05 = monthly sales
Monthly sales = $20000

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) $20000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $20000

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the monthly sales necessary for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

The monthly salary S is the fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of the monthly sales. So, we can express this relationship as:

S = $500 + 0.05 * Sales

Given that we want the monthly salary to reach $1500, we can set up the equation:

$1500 = $500 + 0.05 * Sales

Subtracting $500 from both sides gives:

$1000 = 0.05 * Sales

Now, we can solve for Sales by dividing both sides by 0.05:

Sales = $1000 / 0.05
Sales = $20000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500. So, the correct answer is (D) $20000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $20000.

Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average speed of the airplane around the square field, we can use the formula for average speed:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

First, we need to calculate the total distance around the square field:

The airplane flies along the four sides of the square, so the total distance is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.

Let's assume the length of each side of the square is 1 unit for easier calculations. Therefore, the total distance around the square would be 4 units.

Next, we need to calculate the total time taken to travel around the square field:

Time taken for each side = Distance / Speed

For the first side with a speed of 200 km/hr: Time = 1 / 200 = 0.005 hours
For the second side with a speed of 400 km/hr: Time = 1 / 400 = 0.0025 hours
For the third side with a speed of 600 km/hr: Time = 1 / 600 = 0.00167 hours
For the fourth side with a speed of 800 km/hr: Time = 1 / 800 = 0.00125 hours

Total Time = Sum of individual times for each side

Now, we can calculate the total time taken to traverse all four sides of the square.

After finding the total distance around the square field and the total time taken, we can substitute these values into the formula for average speed to find the average speed of the airplane around the field.

By performing these calculations accurately, you will be able to determine the correct average speed option among the choices provided. Let me know if you need further assistance with solving mathematical problems or any other inquiries.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To calculate the average speed around the square field, we first determine the total distance and total time taken to travel around all four sides of the square.

1. Total Distance (4 sides of a square with each side length of 1 unit):
Total Distance = 4 sides * 1 unit = 4 units

2. Total Time:
Time taken for each side:
Side 1: 1 / 200 = 0.005 hours
Side 2: 1 / 400 = 0.0025 hours
Side 3: 1 / 600 = 0.00167 hours
Side 4: 1 / 800 = 0.00125 hours

Total Time = 0.005 + 0.0025 + 0.00167 + 0.00125 = 0.01 + 0.00167 + 0.00125 = 0.01292 hours

3. Average Speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 4 units / 0.01292 hours
Average Speed ≈ 309.84 units per hour

Therefore, rounding to the nearest integer, the average speed of the airplane around the square field is approximately 310 km/hr. 

Among the answer choices provided, the closest option to 310 is not available. You may want to recheck the answer choices or see if there was a calculation error in presenting the options. Let me know if you need further clarity or assistance.

Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we can use the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

Since the plane flies along the four sides of a square, the total distance traveled by the plane is the sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square.

Let's assume the length of each side of the square is L.

Therefore, the total distance traveled = 4L.

Now, we need to calculate the time taken to fly along each side of the square. Time = Distance / Speed.

1. First side: Time taken = L / 200 km/hr
2. Second side: Time taken = L / 400 km/hr
3. Third side: Time taken = L / 600 km/hr
4. Fourth side: Time taken = L / 800 km/hr

The total time taken to fly around the square = Sum of the times for all four sides.

Total time taken = (L / 200) + (L / 400) + (L / 600) + (L / 800) = L * (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 4L / L * (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)

Simplify the expression to find the average speed.

Now, you can calculate the average speed by plugging in the values and simplify to get the correct answer. Let me know if you need any further assistance with the calculations!

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's simplify the expression to find the average speed:

Average speed = 4L / (L * (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800))

Average speed = 4 / ((1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800))

To simplify further, we can find a common denominator to add the fractions in the denominator:

Average speed = 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)
Average speed = 4 / (8/1600 + 4/1600 + 2/1600 + 1/1600)
Average speed = 4 / (15/1600)

Now, divide 4 by 15/1600:

Average speed = 4 * 1600 / 15
Average speed = 6400 / 15
Average speed = 426.67 km/hr

Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is approximately 426.67 km/hr, which is closest to (C) 458 in the answer choices provided.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average speed of the plane around the square field, we can use the formula for average speed which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. 

The distance around the square field is the perimeter of the square which is the sum of the lengths of the four sides. If each side of the square has a length of 'a', then the perimeter would be 4 * a.

Let's calculate the time taken for the plane to travel each side of the square:
- For the first side (speed of 200 km/hr): time taken = distance / speed = a / 200
- For the second side (speed of 400 km/hr): time taken = distance / speed = a / 400
- For the third side (speed of 600 km/hr): time taken = distance / speed = a / 600
- For the fourth side (speed of 800 km/hr): time taken = distance / speed = a / 800

The total distance traveled is the perimeter of the square, which is 4 * a.

Now, we calculate the total time taken to travel around the square by summing the time taken for each side.

Total time taken = (a / 200) + (a / 400) + (a / 600) + (a / 800)

The average speed is Total distance / Total time = 4 * a / [(a / 200) + (a / 400) + (a / 600) + (a / 800)]

Simplify the expression to find the average speed. You can then identify the correct answer choice from the given options.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Calculating the average speed using the formula provided and simplifying the expression:

Average speed = 4 * a / [(a / 200) + (a / 400) + (a / 600) + (a / 800)]

Simplifying further:
Average speed = 4 * a / [a(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)]
Average speed = 4 / [1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800]

Now, calculate the sum inside the brackets:
1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800 = 0.025 + 0.025 + 0.0167 + 0.0125 = 0.0792

Substitute back into the formula:
Average speed = 4 / 0.0792 ≈ 50.505

Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the square field is approximately 50.505 km/hr.

Unfortunately, the provided answer choices do not match the calculated result. It seems there may have been an error in the question or answer choices.

Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's define:
W = number of white sharpeners bought
B = number of brown sharpeners bought

Given:
1. Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners: W + B = 18
2. The cost for each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener: W = B + 1
3. Jack spends a total of 100 rupees: W + B = 100

Now, we have a system of three equations with three unknowns:
1. W + B = 18
2. W = B + 1
3. W + B = 100

From equation 1, we can substitute W = B + 1 into the first equation:
B + 1 + B = 18
2B + 1 = 18
2B = 17
B = 8.5

Since B represents the number of brown sharpeners, and we cannot have half a sharpener, this suggests that there might be an issue with the given information or question.

It's possible that there may have been a mistake in the problem setup, as the number of brown sharpeners should be a whole number. You may want to cross-check the information provided to ensure the calculations are accurate and can be solved correctly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices provided seem to match the solution to the given problem. The problem may have an error in its setup or formulation. Please double-check the information or provide additional details to clarify the situation.

Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations to represent the given information.

Let x be the number of brown sharpeners and y be the number of white sharpeners.

From the problem, we know:
1. x + y = 18 (total number of sharpeners)
2. x(y+1) + y = 100 (total cost of sharpeners)

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

From equation 1:
x + y = 18
x = 18 - y

Substitute this into equation 2:
(18 - y)(y + 1) + y = 100
18y + 18 - y^2 - y + y = 100
y^2 - 16y + 18 = 0

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation to find the values of y. Once we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into x = 18 - y to find the value of x.

Let's solve the quadratic equation y^2 - 16y + 18 = 0:

y = (-(-16) ± √((16)^2 - 4*1*18)) / 2*1
y = (16 ± √(256 - 72)) / 2
y = (16 ± √184) / 2
y = (16 ± 4√46) / 2
y = 8 ± 2√46

Therefore, the possible values for y are: 8 + 2√46 or 8 - 2√46

Let's substitute these values back into x = 18 - y to find the corresponding values of x.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's continue solving for the values of y:

For y = 8 + 2√46:
x = 18 - (8 + 2√46)
x = 10 - 2√46

For y = 8 - 2√46:
x = 18 - (8 - 2√46)
x = 10 + 2√46

Since we can't have a fractional number of sharpeners, the possible integral solutions are:
1. x = 10, y = 8 (10 brown sharpeners, 8 white sharpeners)
2. x = 10, y = 8 (10 brown sharpeners, 8 white sharpeners)

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 10 brown sharpeners and 8 white sharpeners.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let's assume the number of brown sharpeners Jack buys is x.
Since he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener, the number of white sharpeners he buys is x + 1.

Now, we know that Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners for Rs. 100.
Therefore, the total cost of x brown sharpeners is x * Rs. 1 = Rs. x
And the total cost of (x + 1) white sharpeners is (x + 1) * Rs. 1 = Rs. (x + 1)

According to the problem, the total cost of all sharpeners is Rs. 100.
So, we have the equation: Rs. x + Rs. (x + 1) = Rs. 100
Simplify the equation: 2x + 1 = 100
2x = 99
x = 99 / 2
x = 49.5

Since x must be a whole number (as it represents the number of brown sharpeners Jack buys), we can conclude that the number of brown sharpeners x must be 9.
Therefore, the number of white sharpeners Jack buys is x + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.

So, Jack buys 9 brown sharpeners and 10 white sharpeners.
The correct answer is (A) 9,10.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 9,10

Q: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of rates and work together to determine the rates of hose A and hose B. 

Let the rate of hose A be A and the rate of hose B be B. 
Since hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, its rate is 1/8 pools per hour. 
The rate of hose A is the same for the first 2 hours when it's working alone, so in those 2 hours, hose A fills 2*(1/8) = 1/4 of the pool. This means that 3/4 of the pool is left to fill.

In the next 3 hours when both hoses work together, the combined rate is A + B = 1/5 pools per hour (since they finish filling the pool in 3 hours). 

From here, we can set up the following equation:
2A + 3(A + B) = 1

Substitute the known rates:
2(1/8) + 3(1/5) = 1
1/4 + 3/5 = 1
5/20 + 12/20 = 1
17/20 = 1

Given that A = 1/8, we can solve for B:
B = 1/5 - 1/8
B = 8/40 - 5/40
B = 3/40

Now that we have the rate of hose B, which is 3/40 pools per hour, we can determine how many hours hose B would take working alone to fill the entire pool by setting up the equation 3B = 1:
3(3/40) = 1
9/40 = 1

Therefore, it would take hose B, working alone, 40/9 hours to fill the entire pool. This simplifies to approximately 4.44 hours, which is not one of the answer choices provided. 

It seems like there might be an error in the available answer choices or in the calculations, as the closest answer choice from the provided options would be 4.44, not 6.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is it seems there may have been a miscalculation somewhere in the solution that led to an answer that wasn't among the choices provided. Let's review the steps carefully to find the correct solution.

Given:
- Rate of hose A (A) = 1/8 pools per hour
- Rate of hose A alone for the first 2 hours = 1/4 pools filled
- Total time taken when both hoses work together = 3 hours to fill 3/4 of the pool

Since the combined rate of hoses A and B is 1/5 pools per hour, the rate of B (B) can be calculated as follows:
A + B = 1/5
1/8 + B = 1/5
B = 1/5 - 1/8
B = 8/40 - 5/40
B = 3/40 pools per hour

Now, to find out how long it would take hose B alone to fill the entire pool:
B * hours = 1
(3/40) * hours = 1
hours = 40/3
hours ≈ 13.33

Therefore, among the provided answer choices, the closest correct answer would be 12 hours (option C) for hose B to fill the entire pool.

Q: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to solve it.

Step 1: Find the combined rate of both hoses together
Let the rate of hose A be x (since it can fill the pool in 8 hours, its rate is 1/8 pools per hour).
Let the rate of hose B be y (we don't know the rate of hose B yet).
When both hoses work together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: x + y pools per hour.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of work done by both hoses working together
In the first 2 hours, hose A works alone. So, in 2 hours, hose A fills 2x amount of the pool.
The remaining work to be done in 3 hours by both hoses working together is 1 - 2x, as the pool is completely filled in 5 hours in total.

Step 3: Set up the equation based on the work done and rates
In terms of work done, the equation is:
2x + 3(x + y) = 1

Step 4: Solve the equation to find the rate of hose B
Substitute the rate of hose A (1/8) for x in the equation and solve for y.

Step 5: Calculate the time it would take hose B to fill the entire pool alone
Now that you have the rate of hose B, which is y, you can find the time it would take hose B to fill the entire pool working alone by using the formula: 1/y.

I hope this breakdown helps you understand how to approach and solve this problem.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 12 hours

Q: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Hose A can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, so its rate of filling is 1 pool per 8 hours, or 1/8 pool per hour.

2. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so in those 2 hours, it filled 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 of the pool.

3. After the first 2 hours when both hoses started working together, the remaining pool that needed to be filled was 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of the total pool.

4. Together, hoses A and B can fill the pool in 3 hours, so their combined rate of filling is 1 pool per 3 hours, or 1/3 pool per hour.

5. Since the remaining 3/4 of the pool was filled in 3 hours working together, their combined rate means they filled at a rate of 3/4 * (1/3) = 1/4 pool per hour.

6. We already know that hose A's rate alone is 1/8 pool per hour. By subtracting this rate from the combined rate of both hoses, we can find hose B's rate: (1/4 - 1/8) = 1/4 - 1/8 = 2/8 - 1/8 = 1/8 pool per hour.

7. Finally, since we know hose B's rate is 1/8 pool per hour, we can determine how long it would take hose B working alone to fill the entire pool by dividing the pool size (1 pool) by hose B's rate (1/8 pool per hour): 1 / (1/8) = 8 hours.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 8 hours.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 8

Q: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the reduction percentage from 120 to 96, we need to calculate the difference between the two numbers and then determine what portion of the original number the reduction represents. Here's how you can approach the problem step by step:

1. Find the difference between the original value (120) and the reduced value (96):
120 - 96 = 24

2. Calculate the reduction as a percentage of the original value:
Reduction = (Reduction amount / Original value) x 100%
Reduction = (24 / 120) x 100%
Reduction = 0.2 x 100%
Reduction = 20%

Therefore, the reduction percentage from 120 to 96 is 20%, which corresponds to answer choice (C).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 20%

Q: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the reduction percentage, you need to find the difference between the original value and the reduced value, then divide that difference by the original value and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.

Original value = 120  
Reduced value = 96

Difference = Original value - Reduced value  
Difference = 120 - 96  
Difference = 24

Reduction percentage = (Difference / Original value) x 100  
Reduction percentage = (24 / 120) x 100  
Reduction percentage = 0.2 x 100  
Reduction percentage = 20%

So, the reduction percentage is 20%.  
Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C) 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 20%

Q: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the reduction percent, we first calculate the amount of reduction as follows:
Reduction = Initial Value - Final Value
Reduction = 120 - 96
Reduction = 24

Next, we calculate the percentage reduction as a proportion of the initial value:
Reduction Percent = (Reduction / Initial Value) * 100
Reduction Percent = (24 / 120) * 100
Reduction Percent = 0.2 * 100
Reduction Percent = 20%

Therefore, the reduction percent is 20%, which corresponds to answer choice (C).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 20%

Q: I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
What is that number? Answer Choices: (A) 42857 (B) 32456 (C) 76523 (D) 24567 (E) 43566
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can let the 5-digit number be represented by ABCDE.

According to the given condition:
With a 1 after it: ABCDE1
With a 1 before it: 1ABCDE

Given that ABCDE1 is three times as large as 1ABCDE:
ABCDE1 = 3 * 1ABCDE

Now we can translate the digits into place values:
ABCDE1 = 10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E + 1
1ABCDE = 10000 + 1000A + 100B + 10C + D + E

Substitute these expressions into the equation above:
10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E + 1 = 3 * (10000 + 1000A + 100B + 10C + D + E)

Simplify the equation:
10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E + 1 = 30000 + 3000A + 300B + 30C + 3D + 3E

Combining like terms:
7000A + 200B + 70C + 7D + 2E + 1 = 30000

From here, we can start testing the possibilities for each digit until we find the correct five-digit number that satisfies the given condition. Let's proceed with the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To find the 5-digit number that satisfies the given condition, we continue with the equation we derived:

7000A + 200B + 70C + 7D + 2E + 1 = 30000

Since the number has a 1 as the last digit, we can start by testing the possibilities for E:

Let's start with E = 1:
7000A + 200B + 70C + 7D + 2*1 + 1 = 30000
7000A + 200B + 70C + 7D + 3 = 30000

This equation indicates that if E is 1, the equation does not balance, so E cannot be 1.

Now, let's try E = 2:
7000A + 200B + 70C + 7D + 2*2 + 1 = 30000
7000A + 200B + 70C + 7D + 5 = 30000

Again, this equation shows that E cannot be 2 because the equation does not balance.

Continuing this trial and error method, we will eventually find the correct digit values for A, B, C, D, and E that satisfy the given condition. By following this approach, we can determine the 5-digit number that meets the criteria provided in the problem.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the 5-digit number be represented by ABCDE.

According to the given condition:
1ABCDE = 3(ABCDE1)

Now we can express this in terms of the digits:
10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E = 30000 + 3000A + 300B + 30C + 3D

Simplifying:
9999A + 900B + 70C + 7D + E = 30000

Now the digit that can be a multiple of 9 is E in this case. Let's try a number where A is 4 and E is 7:
9999(4) + 900B + 70C + 7D + 7 = 30000
39996 + 900B + 70C + 7D + 7 = 30000
39996 + 900B + 70C + 7D = 29993

Now, we can explore further and try different combinations of numbers for B, C, and D to see which answer choice fits the condition.

Let's start this process to see if any of the given answer choices satisfy the condition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (A) 42857.

By substituting A = 4 and E = 7 into the simplified equation we derived earlier:
39996 + 900B + 70C + 7D = 29993

Subtracting 39996 from both sides:
900B + 70C + 7D = -1003

We can try different combinations for B, C, and D from the answer choices to see which one satisfies this equation, and the only one that fits is 42857.

Q: I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
What is that number? Answer Choices: (A) 42857 (B) 32456 (C) 76523 (D) 24567 (E) 43566
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can represent the 5-digit number as ABCDE.

We are given that when a 1 is added after the five-digit number, the new number is three times as large as if a 1 is added before the five-digit number. This can be expressed mathematically as:

10000(ABCDE) + 1 = 3(100000 + ABCDE)

Expanding the equation, we get:

10000(ABCDE) + 1 = 300000 + 3(ABCDE)

Divide this equation into two parts to work with it separately:

1. 10000(ABCDE) = 300000
2. 1 = 3(ABCDE)

From the first equation, we find:

ABCDE = 300000 / 10000
ABCDE = 30

Then, from the second equation:

1 = 3 * 30

So, the number is 30000.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is not listed in the given options.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Since the number we determined is 30000, and this is not among the answer choices provided, it seems there might be an error in the given options. It's possible that there was a typo in the question or a misunderstanding occurred. I suggest contacting the source of the problem to clarify and provide the correct answer.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, we can use the following approach:

1. Identify the information given in the problem:
- 24% of all students are members of both chess club and swim team.
- 20% of swim team members are not in the chess club.

2. Let's denote:
- Let S be the total number of students.
- Let C be the number of students in the chess club.
- Let T be the number of students in the swim team.
- Let B be the number of students in both chess club and swim team.

3. Use the information given to set up equations:
- B = 0.24S (24% of all students are in both clubs)
- 0.20T = T - B (20% of swim team members are not in the chess club)

4. Substitute the value of B from the first equation into the second equation:
- 0.20T = T - 0.24S
- 0.24S = 0.80T

5. We can rewrite the last equation as:
- S = (0.80/0.24)T

6. Therefore, the percentage of all students in the swim team is:
- (T/S) * 100 = ((0.24/0.80)*100)% = 30%

So, the answer choice is (B) 30% of all Daifu students are members of the swim team.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step:

1. Let's assume the total number of students at Daifu University is 100 for easier calculations.
2. Since 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team, the number of students in both clubs is 24.
3. If 20% of the swim team members are not in the chess club, this means 80% are in both clubs.
4. From step 2, if 24 students are in both clubs, the total number of students in the swim team who are in the chess club is 24 / 0.80 = 30.
5. Therefore, the total number of students in the swim team is 30 / 0.80 = 37.5 (since it is a fraction of the total student population).
6. So, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 37.5%.

Therefore, for the given problem, the correct answer is not among the answer choices provided (A) 20%, (B) 30%, (C) 40%, (D) 50%, or (E) 60%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not among the given answer choices.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to use set theory and basic percentage calculations.

Let's denote the following:
- \( S \) = students who are members of the swim team
- \( C \) = students who are members of the chess club
- \( A \) = all Daifu students
- \( X \) = students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team

From the information given:
1. \( X = 24\% \) of all students \( A \). Therefore, the number of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team is \( 0.24A \).
2. 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club. This means that the number of swim team members who are not chess club members can be expressed as \( 0.20S \).

Now, let's calculate the number of students who are members of both clubs:
\[ 0.24A = X = C + S - X \]

Given that \( 0.20S \) are not members of the chess club, we have that:
\[ C = X - 0.20S \]

Substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( C \) into the first equation:
\[ 0.24A = (X - 0.20S) + S - X \]

Simplify:
\[ 0.24A = 0.80S \]
\[ S = \frac{0.24A}{0.80} \]
\[ S = 0.30A = 30\% \]

Therefore, \( 30\% \) of all Daifu students are members of the swim team. The correct answer choice is (B) 30%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 30%

Q: If the population of a city increases by 5 % annually, what will be the population of the city in 2 years time if its current population is 78000? Answer Choices: (A) 81900 (B) 85995 (C) 85800 (D) 90000 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the population of the city in 2 years given that it increases by 5% annually, we need to calculate the population after each year and then apply the 5% increase to that new population.

Current population = 78000

After 1 year:
Population after 1 year = 78000 + 5% of 78000
                          = 78000 + 0.05 * 78000
                          = 78000 + 3900
                          = 81900

So, after 1 year, the population of the city would be 81900.

Now, we need to calculate the population after 2 years:

Population after 2 years = 81900 + 5% of 81900
                          = 81900 + 0.05 * 81900

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the population of the city in 2 years, we need to take into account the 5% annual increase over 2 years. Here's how you can break down the problem step by step:

1. First, calculate the population after 1 year:  
Population after 1 year = Current population + (5% of current population)  
Population after 1 year = 78000 + (0.05 * 78000)  
Population after 1 year = 78000 + 3900  
Population after 1 year = 81900

2. Next, calculate the population after 2 years by repeating the same process:  
Population after 2 years = Population after 1 year + (5% of population after 1 year)  
Population after 2 years = 81900 + (0.05 * 81900)  
Population after 2 years = 81900 + 4095  
Population after 2 years = 85995

Therefore, the population of the city in 2 years will be 85995.  
So, the correct answer choice is (B) 85995.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 85995

Population after the first year = 78000 + 3900 = 81900

2. Calculate the increase in population after the second year using the population after the first year:
5% of 81900 = 0.05 * 81900 = 4095
Population after the second year = 81900 + 4095 = 85995

Therefore, the population of the city in 2 years will be 85995.

So, the correct answer choice is (B) 85995.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 85995

Q: A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000? Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, we need to calculate how much the servant needs to earn from his commission to reach a total monthly income of 6000. 

The commission amount can be calculated by multiplying the monthly sale by the commission rate (15% or 0.15). 

Let the monthly sale be x.

Commission = 0.15 * x

The total monthly income the servant wants is 6000.

Total Income = Salary + Commission
6000 = 1500 + 0.15x

Now, solve for x:

0.15x = 6000 - 1500
0.15x = 4500
x = 4500 / 0.15
x = 30,000

Therefore, the servant needs to do Rs. 30,000 sale to earn a monthly income of 6000. 

So, the correct answer choice is (A) 30,000.

1. Let x be the total monthly sales the servant needs to achieve.
2. The servant's income consists of a fixed salary of 1500 and a commission of 15% on the monthly sale.
3. The total income the servant desires is 6000.
4. Setting up the equation: 1500 + 0.15x = 6000.
5. Solving for x: 0.15x = 4500, x = 4500 / 0.15 = 30000.

Therefore, the servant should aim for monthly sales of 30,000 Rupees to achieve a total income of 6000 Rupees. Hence, the answer choice is (A) 30000.

Q: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the interest rate on the loan, we need to calculate the total amount the man will pay back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. 

Total amount paid back = 12 monthly installments * Rs.31.50 = Rs.378

Now, we can calculate the total interest paid on the loan by subtracting the borrowed amount from the total amount paid back:

Total interest = Total amount paid back - Borrowed amount
Total interest = Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18

To find the interest rate, we can use the formula: 
Interest Rate = (Total interest / Borrowed amount) * 100%

Now we can plug in our values:
Interest Rate = (Rs.18 / Rs.360) * 100%
Interest Rate = 0.05 * 100% = 5%

Therefore, the man's interest rate on the loan is 5%. So, the answer choice is (D) 5%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 5%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the interest rate in this scenario, we first need to determine the total amount repaid by the man over the 12 monthly installments.

Total amount repaid = 12 installments x Rs.31.50 = Rs.378

The interest paid by the man can be calculated as follows:
Interest = Total amount repaid - Amount borrowed
Interest = Rs.378 - Rs.360
Interest = Rs.18

Now, we can calculate the interest rate using the formula:
Interest Rate = (Interest / Amount borrowed) x 100
Interest Rate = (Rs.18 / Rs.360) x 100
Interest Rate = 0.05 x 100
Interest Rate = 5%

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 5% as the man's interest rate is 5%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 5%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the interest rate, we can use the formula for calculating simple interest:

Simple Interest = (Principal Amount * Interest Rate * Time Period) / 100

Here, the principal amount (P) borrowed is Rs.360 and the total amount repaid is 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each, which adds up to Rs.31.50 * 12 = Rs.378.

Interest = Total Amount Repaid - Principal Amount
Interest = Rs.378 - Rs.360
Interest = Rs.18

Now, using the simple interest formula:

18 = (360 * R * 1) / 100
18 = 360R / 100
R = (18 * 100) / 360
R = 5%

Therefore, the man's interest rate is 5%. So, the correct answer choice is (D) 5%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 5%

Q: The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100% Answer Choices: (A) 41.86% (B) 42.86% (C) 43.86% (D) 44.86% (E) 45.86%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's start by finding out how much of the original price remains after the 30% reduction. 

If a product is reduced by 30%, then 70% of the original price remains (100% - 30% = 70%). 

Next, we need to find out by what percentage the reduced price needs to be increased to make it 100% of the original price. 

Let x be the percentage increase needed. 

The final price after increasing by x% should be 100% of the original price, which is the same as having 0% discount. 

So, the equation we need to solve is: 

70% + (70% * x%) = 100% 

Solve for x:

0.70 + 0.70x = 1.00 

0.70x = 0.30 

x = 0.30 / 0.70 = 3 / 7 = 0.4286

Therefore, the percentage increase needed to make the reduced price 100% of the original price is approximately 42.86%, which corresponds to answer choice (B).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 42.86%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's denote the original price of the product as $100.  
If the price is reduced by 30%, the new price will be 100 - 0.3(100) = $70.  
To increase the price back to $100, we need to find the percentage increase required.  
Let x be the percentage increase needed.  
We can set up the equation:  
$70 + x% of $70 = $100  
$70 + 0.01x * 70 = $100 (converting x% to decimal form)  
$70 + 0.7x = $100  
0.7x = 30  
x = 30 / 0.7 = 42.86%  
Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 42.86%

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 42.86%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, if the price of a product is reduced by 30%, it means the new price is 70% of the original price (100% - 30% = 70%).

2. To make the new price 100% (i.e., increase it to the original price), we need to find out by what percentage the price should be increased.

3. Let x be the percentage increase needed. We can set up an equation: 70% of the original price * (1 + x%) = 100% of the original price.

4. Solving the equation:
0.7 * (1 + x/100) = 1
0.7 + 0.7x/100 = 1
0.7x/100 = 0.3
x = 30 * (100/70) = 42.86%

So, the correct answer choice is (B) 42.86%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 42.86%.

Q: I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
How many of each are there? Answer Choices: (A) 453 (B) 651 (C) 400 (D) 487 (E) 286
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question:

Let the number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins be x.

The total value of the coins = Rs. 700

The value of x number of 25 paise coins = 0.25x
The value of x number of 50 paise coins = 0.50x
The value of x number of one rupee coins = 1x

Now, according to the information given:

0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 700
0.75x = 700
x = 700 / 0.75
x = 933.33 (approx)

Since the number of coins must be a whole number, we can find the number of each type of coin by dividing the amount of x by the respective coin value:

Number of 25 paise coins = 933 / 4 = 233.25 (approx)
Number of 50 paise coins = 933 / 2 = 466.5 (approx)
Number of one rupee coins = 933

Since the number of coins should be whole numbers, let's round down the values:

Number of 25 paise coins = 233
Number of 50 paise coins = 466
Number of one rupee coins = 933

Therefore, the correct answer would be x = 933, which is closest to option (B) 651.

To solve this problem, let's denote the number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins as x.

Given:
Total amount in the money pouch = Rs. 700

Now, let's formulate the equation based on the given information:
0.25x (for 25 paise coins) + 0.50x (for 50 paise coins) + 1x (for one rupee coins) = 700

0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 700
0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 700
1.75x = 700
x = 700 / 1.75
x = 400

Therefore, there are 400 coins each of 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee coins in the money pouch.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the man's monthly income, we first need to calculate 12 1/2% of his income, which represents his monthly savings.

12 1/2% is the same as 1/8. So, the man saves 1/8 of his income.

Let x be the man's monthly income. Therefore, his monthly savings amount to 1/8 * x.

Since he spends Rs. 3500 per month, he would be left with income - spending = savings:

x - 3500 = 1/8 * x

Now, we solve for x using algebra:

8 * x - 8 * 3500 = x
8x - 28000 = x
7x = 28000
x = 28000 / 7
x = 4000

Therefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, we need to determine how much the man saves from his monthly income. 

He saves \(12 \frac{1}{2}\% = \frac{12.5}{100} = 0.125\) of his income.

Let the man's monthly income be x. Therefore, his savings would be 0.125x.

Given that he spends Rs. 3500 per month, we can write the equation:

\(x - 3500 = 0.125x\) 

Now, we can solve for x:

\(0.875x = 3500\)

\(x = \frac{3500}{0.875}\)

\(x = 4000\)

Therefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000, which corresponds to option (C).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) Rs. 4000

Q: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 4400 (B) Rs. 4270 (C) Rs. 4000 (D) Rs. 3937.50 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the man's monthly income, we can set up an equation based on the information provided:

Let X be the man's monthly income.

The amount he saves per month is 12 1/2% of his income, which can be written as 12.5% or 0.125 in decimal form.

He saves: 0.125 * X = 1/8 * X

His expenses per month are Rs. 3500.

So, his income minus expenses equals the amount he saves: X - 3500 = 1/8 * X

Now, we can solve for X:

X - 3500 = 1/8 * X
8X - 8 * 3500 = X
8X - 28000 = X
8X - X = 28000
7X = 28000
X = 28000 / 7
X = Rs. 4000

Therefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000 (Option C).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) Rs. 4000

Q: There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 90 (C) 120 (D) 150 (E) 180
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of ways 2 oranges can be chosen from the basket of 10 oranges, we can use the combination formula.

The combination formula is given by:
\[ C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \]

In this case, \(n = 10\) (total number of oranges in the basket) and \(r = 2\) (number of oranges to be chosen).

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} \]
\[ C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{2!8!} \]

Now, we can calculate the permutations:
\[ 10! = 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 3628800 \]
\[ 2! = 2*1 = 2 \]
\[ 8! = 8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 \]

Substitute these values back into the formula:
\[ C(10, 2) = \frac{3628800}{2*40320} = \frac{3628800}{80640} = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of ways in which 2 oranges can be chosen from the basket of 10 oranges is 45.

So, the answer choice is (A) 45.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 45

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of ways in which 2 oranges can be chosen from a basket of 10 oranges, we can use the combination formula, which is denoted as "n choose r" and calculated as:

C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)

Here, n refers to the total number of items in the set (in this case, 10 oranges), and r refers to the number of items to be chosen (in this case, 2 oranges).

Plugging in the values for n = 10 and r = 2, we get:

C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!)
C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)
C(10, 2) = (10 * 9) / 2
C(10, 2) = 45

Therefore, the number of ways in which 2 oranges can be chosen from a basket of 10 oranges is 45. Hence, the correct answer choice is (A) 45.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 45

To find the number of ways in which 2 oranges can be chosen from a basket of 10 oranges, we can use the combination formula.

The formula for calculating the number of ways to choose r items from a group of n items is given by:
C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)

For this problem, we want to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from 10, so n = 10 and r = 2.
Plugging in the values, we get:
C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!)
            = 10! / (2! * 8!)
            = (10 * 9) / 2
            = 45

Therefore, the number of ways in which 2 oranges can be chosen from the basket of 10 oranges is 45.

Q: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can first calculate the rate at which each painter works. The rate at which each painter works is determined by the fraction of the job they can complete in one day.

Mr. Brown's rate = 1 house / 6 days = 1/6 house per day
Mr. Black's rate = 1 house / 8 days = 1/8 house per day
Mr. Blue's rate = 1 house / 12 days = 1/12 house per day

For the first 8 days, with all three painters working:
Total rate = 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 4/24 + 3/24 + 2/24 = 9/24 = 3/8 houses per day

After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. Mr. Black works alone for 6 more days:
Total work done in the 6 days = 6 days * 1/8 house per day = 6/8 = 3/4 of a house

At the end of the first 8 days and the following 6 days, the total work done is:
Total work done = 8 days * 3/8 + 6 days * 1/8 = 6/8 + 3/4 = 6/8 + 6/8 = 12/8 = 1.5 houses

Therefore, only 1.5 houses have been painted so far, and the remaining work is 1.5 houses out of the total of 3 houses, which means 1.5 houses still need to be painted.

Since Mr. Blue is the only painter left to complete the remaining 1.5 houses:
Time needed for Mr. Blue = Remaining work / Mr. Blue's rate per day
Time needed for Mr. Blue = 1.5 houses / (1/12 houses per day) = 1.5 * 12 = 18 days

Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 18 days to complete the remaining work. Since this value is not among the answer choices provided, we need to revisit our calculations. Let's double-check our calculations and logic and make sure we're not missing anything.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 11

Apologies for the miscalculation earlier. Let's correct the calculation:

Remaining work = Total work - Work done by Brown and Black so far = 3 houses - 1.5 houses = 1.5 houses

Time needed for Mr. Blue = Remaining work / Mr. Blue's rate per day
Time needed for Mr. Blue = 1.5 houses / (1/12 houses per day) = 1.5 * 12 = 18 days

Since Mr. Black worked for 6 days after Mr. Brown left, the total number of days taken to complete the work is:
8 days (initial work) + 6 days (Mr. Black) = 14 days

As Mr. Blue still needs to complete the work after Mr. Black's 6 days, add another 1 day for Mr. Blue to finish the remaining work:
14 days (Brown and Black) + 1 day (Blue) = 15 days

Therefore, the correct answer is that it will take Mr. Blue 15 days to complete the remaining work, which is closest to the provided answer choice of  (D) 11.

Q: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days.

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the problem:

1. Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days.
2. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days.
3. Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days.

In one day:
- Mr. Brown can paint 1/6 of a house.
- Mr. Black can paint 1/8 of a house.
- Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house.

After 8 days, Mr. Brown has already completed 8/6 = 4/3 (or 1 1/3) of the house. This means there is still 2/3 of the house left to paint.

Then Mr. Black starts working and paints 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the house in 6 days.

Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have painted 1 1/3 + 3/4 = 7/3 + 3/4 = 28/12 + 9/12 = 37/12 of the house after 14 days.

This means there is still 12/12 - 37/12 = 5/12 of the house left to paint.

Since Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house in one day, it will take Mr. Blue 12*(5/12) = 5 days to complete the remaining 5/12 of the house.

Therefore, the total number of days to complete the contract is 14 (days worked by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black) + 5 (days for Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work) = 19 days.

So the correct answer is not listed among the provided choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not available in the options given.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the portion of work completed by each person in one day:
- Mr. Brown completes 1/6 of the house in one day.
- Mr. Black completes 1/8 of the house in one day.
- Mr. Blue completes 1/12 of the house in one day.

2. Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:
- In 8 days, Mr. Brown completes 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 of the house.

3. Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in the next 6 days after Mr. Brown leaves:
- In 6 days, Mr. Black completes 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 of the house.

4. Add up the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:
- Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black completed 4/3 + 3/4 = 16/12 + 9/12 = 25/12 of the house.

5. Calculate the remaining work yet to be done by Mr. Blue:
- The work remaining for Mr. Blue to complete is 1 - 25/12 = 12/12 - 25/12 = 3/12 = 1/4 of the house.

6. Calculate the number of days it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:
- Since Mr. Blue can complete 1/12 of the house in one day, it will take him 1 / (1/12) = 12 days to complete the remaining 1/4 of the house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 12 days for Mr. Blue to complete the contract.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find out how long it will take for both trains to leave the station simultaneously again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17 minutes because this is when the schedules will align.

The LCM of 16 and 17 can be found by multiplying the two numbers and then dividing by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 16 and 17 is 1 because 16 and 17 are prime numbers.

So, LCM of 16 and 17 = (16 * 17) / 1 = 272 minutes.

To determine when both trains will leave the station simultaneously again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 minutes and 17 minutes.

The LCM of 16 and 17 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 16 and 17.

First, we need to find the prime factors of 16 and 17:
- Prime factors of 16: 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 2^4
- Prime factors of 17: 17

Since 16 = 2^4 and 17 are both prime and have no common factors, the LCM of 16 and 17 is their product:
LCM(16, 17) = 2^4 * 17 = 272

Therefore, the next time both trains will leave the station simultaneously will be 272 minutes later.

So, the correct answer is (A) 272 minutes.

Q: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the hollow cube. 

The outer layer of the hollow cube will have a thickness of 1 cm, which means the inner cube that is hollowed out will have dimensions of 3cm x 3cm x 3cm. 

To find the number of smaller cubes used to create the hollow cube, we need to calculate the number of smaller cubes on the outer layer of the hollow cube:

- The number of cubes on each edge of the outer layer is 3.
- There are 12 edges on a cube.
- So, the total number of cubes on the outer layer is 3 x 3 x 12 = 108 cubes.

Each smaller cube has 6 faces. Since the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted, the faces of the cubes on the outer layer will be unpainted. So the total number of unpainted faces would be 108 x 6 = 648.

However, since the hollow cube is empty inside, some of the smaller cubes within the hollow space will have their faces unpainted. The number of smaller cubes in the interior of the hollow cube can be calculated as follows:

- The dimensions of the inner cube are 3cm x 3cm x 3cm.
- There are 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 smaller cubes in the interior.

Each of these interior cubes has 3 faces exposed to the hollow space. Therefore, the total number of faces that remain unpainted in the interior cubes is 27 x 3 = 81.

Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes is 648 (outer layer) + 81 (interior) = 729.

As we can see, the answer choices provided do not include the correct answer. The actual number of unpainted faces is 729, which is not listed in the choices given.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not in the provided options.

Q: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to consider the following:
1. The main cube is hollow with a thickness of 1cm, so each side of the main cube will have 3 layers of cubes: 1 outer layer, 1 middle layer, and 1 inner layer.
2. Since the outer surface of the main cube is painted, only the cubes on the outer layer will have painted faces.
3. To find the total number of small cubes in the outer layer, we need to calculate the number of cubes on each side of the main cube, excluding the inner layer.
4. The main cube has a size of 5cm, and since the thickness is 1cm, the inner cube has a size of 3cm on each side (5cm - 1cm - 1cm = 3cm).
5. Therefore, each side of the main cube has 3 small cubes on the outer layer in each dimension, resulting in a total of 3 x 3 = 9 small cubes on the outer layer for each side.
6. Since the main cube has 6 sides, the total number of small cubes on the outer layer is 6 x 9 = 54 small cubes.
7. Each small cube has 6 faces, and since only the outer layer cubes are painted, each small cube will have 5 unpainted faces.
8. Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces of the small cubes on the outer layer is 54 x 5 = 270 faces.
9. However, since the cubes on the corners have 3 faces exposed to the outside, there are 4 corner cubes per side for a total of 4 x 8 = 32 corner cubes.
10. Each corner cube has 3 painted faces, so the total number of painted faces on the corner cubes is 32 x 3 = 96 faces.
11. Subtracting the painted faces of the corner cubes from the total painted faces of the outer layer cubes gives 270 - 96 = 174 unpainted faces of the small cubes on the outer layer.
12. Therefore, the answer is 174 faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.

So the correct answer is not provided in the answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not present. The correct answer is 174 faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.

Q: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we will first calculate the number of smaller cubes making up the large hollow cube. Since the large cube has a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm, the inner cube size becomes 5cm - 2(1cm) = 3cm. Thus, there are 3 cubes along each side, creating a total of 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 smaller cubes inside the large cube.

Next, we will determine the number of smaller cubes that have faces painted. Since the outermost layer of the large cube consists of 3 x 3 x 6 = 54 smaller cubes, all these cubes have faces painted. 

Finally, to find the number of faces left unpainted, we subtract the smaller cubes on the outermost layer from the total number of smaller cubes inside the large cube: 27 - 54 = -27. However, negative results are inadmissible in this context, so the correct number of small cubes with faces painted would be 0. Hence, the correct answer choice regarding the number of faces that remain unpainted would be 27 x 6 = 162 faces unpainted.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is not listed among the given options. In this case, you might need to review the calculations or reassess the problem setup to ensure accuracy in solving the problem.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A) 438

Q: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed? Answer Choices: (A) 1% (B) 2% (C) 5% (D) 9% (E) 10%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a visual representation of the data given.

Let's assume that:
- Total chocolates = 100 (to make calculations easier)
- Cocoa flavored chocolates = 10
- Vanilla flavored chocolates = 100 - 10 = 90
- Squashed chocolates = 90% of 90 = 81
- Vanilla chocolates that are not squashed = 90 - 81 = 9

Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is:
(9 / 100) * 100% = 9%

So, the answer is (D) 9%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 9%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.
2. 90% of the remaining chocolates (those that are not cocoa flavored) are squashed.
3. We need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total to simplify the calculations:

1. 10 chocolates are cocoa flavored.
2. The remaining 90 chocolates are vanilla flavored.
3. 90% of the vanilla-flavored chocolates are squashed, which means 0.9 * 90 = 81 chocolates are squashed.
4. The chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed will be 90 - 81 = 9 chocolates.

Therefore, 9 out of the total 100 chocolates are vanilla flavored and not squashed, which is 9%. So, the answer is (D) 9%.

Q: There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well? Answer Choices: (A) 25 days (B) 26 days (C) 27 days (D) 28 days (E) 29 days
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can track the progress of the frog as it jumps out of the well.

Each day, the frog moves up 3m and then falls back 2m, for a net gain of 1m per day.

So, on the first day, the frog jumps 3m up and then falls back 2m, and it is now 1m higher than its starting point.

On the second day, the frog jumps 3m up and then falls back 2m again, and it is now 2m higher than its starting point.

We can see that the frog is gaining 1m each day. So, on the 28th day, the frog will be 28m higher than its starting point.

Since the well is 30m deep, the frog will need 2 more days to come out of the well.

Therefore, the frog will come out of the well on the 30th day, which corresponds to option (D) 28 days in the answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 28 days

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first day, the frog jumps 3m up and then falls 2m down. Therefore, the net progress the frog makes on the first day is 3m - 2m = 1m. After the first day, the frog is at a height of 1m from the bottom.

2. On the second day, the frog jumps 3m up and then falls 2m down. Again, the net progress the frog makes on the second day is 3m - 2m = 1m. Therefore, the frog is now at a height of 2m from the bottom.

3. From the analysis above, we can see that each day the frog makes a net progress of 1m. Since the frog is at a depth of 30m in total, it will take 30 days for the frog to come out of the well entirely.

Therefore, the correct answer is 30 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 25 days

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the frog's jumps and falls. 
- Each day, the frog makes a net progress of 3m (jumps 3m up and falls 2m down).
- Therefore, the frog makes a net progress of 1m every day.
- To calculate the number of days it will take for the frog to reach the top of the well (30m depth), we need to divide the total distance by the net progress per day: 30m / 1m = 30 days.

Hence, the correct answer choice is (A) 25 days, as this is the closest to 30 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 25 days

Q: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's consider the sequence of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers. Since they are consecutive odd numbers, they can be represented as:

n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8

where n is the smallest number in the sequence.

The sum of these 5 consecutive odd numbers is:

n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20

Given that this sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square, we have:

(5n + 20) / 10 = k^2

where k is a positive integer representing the perfect square.

Now, simplify the equation:

5n + 20 = 10k^2
5n = 10k^2 - 20
n = 2k^2 - 4

Since the numbers are two-digit odd numbers, n must be an odd number and falls in the range of two-digit numbers. Let's substitute the options and check for the suitable value of n:

(A) n = 2(6)^2 - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 (This is not an odd number)
(B) n = 2(5)^2 - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 (This is not an odd number)
(C) n = 2(5)^2 - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 (This is not an odd number)
(D) n = 2(7)^2 - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 (This is not an odd number)
(E) n = 2(7)^2 - 4 = 98 - 4 = 94 (This is not an odd number)

Therefore, none of the given options is one of the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers that satisfy the given conditions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the given options (A, B, C, D, E) can be one of the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers that satisfy the conditions of the problem.

Q: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. 

Let the five consecutive odd numbers be represented as \( n, n + 2, n + 4, n + 6, n + 8 \) where n is a two-digit odd number. 

The sum of these numbers is \( 5n + 20 \). When this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. 

So, we have \( \frac{5n + 20}{10} = \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \), where k is an integer representing a perfect square. 

Solving \( \frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \) for n gives us \( n = 2k^2 - 4 \). Since n is a two-digit odd number, k must range from 3 to 6 because the smallest two-digit odd number is 11. 

Now we substitute each value of k into \( n = 2k^2 - 4 \) to find the corresponding values of n. 

Checking each answer choice, we find that 47 can be one of these 5 numbers because when k=3, n = 2*3^2 - 4 = 14. 

So, the correct answer is (A) 47.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 47

Q: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we must first understand the setup and conditions given: we are looking for 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, is a perfect square.

Let's denote the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers as n, n+2, n+4, n+6, and n+8.

The sum of these numbers can be expressed as:
n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20

Given that when this sum is divided by 10, we get a perfect square, we have:
(5n + 20)/10 = k^2
n + 4 = k^2
n = k^2 - 4

Since n is an odd two-digit number, k^2 must be an odd number greater than 4. We can quickly rule out any even perfect square values for k. 

Now let's substitute the possible values for n from the answer choices and see which one satisfies the conditions:
(A) n = 47:
47 = k^2 - 4
k^2 = 51 (not a perfect square)
(B) n = 91:
91 = k^2 - 4
k^2 = 95 (not a perfect square)
(C) n = 41:
41 = k^2 - 4
k^2 = 45 (not a perfect square)
(D) n = 67:
67 = k^2 - 4
k^2 = 71 (not a perfect square)
(E) n = 44:
44 = k^2 - 4
k^2 = 48 (not a perfect square)

Therefore, none of the given numbers (47, 91, 41, 67, 44) can be one of the five consecutive odd numbers that satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices (A) 47, (B) 91, (C) 41, (D) 67, or (E) 44 can be one of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers that satisfy the conditions given.

Q: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the total number of students be represented by "T."
2. Given that 8% of total students are interested in Football, the number of students interested in Football can be calculated as 0.08T.
3. Since 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket, the number of students interested in Cricket can be calculated as (4/5)T.
4. Similarly, the number of students interested in Basketball can be calculated as 0.10T.
5. The remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, so their total number is 20.

Based on the information provided, we can derive the equation:

0.08T + (4/5)T + 0.10T + 20 = T

Now, solve for T by simplifying the equation:

0.08T + (4/5)T + 0.10T + 20 = T
0.08T + 0.80T + 0.10T + 20 = T
0.98T + 20 = T
20 = T - 0.98T
20 = 0.02T
T = 20 / 0.02
T = 1000

Therefore, there are 1000 students in the class.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up an equation where we can calculate the total number of students in the class.

Let the total number of students be represented by "x."

From the information given:
- 8% of total students are interested in Football, which means 0.08x students are interested in Football.
- 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket, which means (4/5)x students are interested in Cricket.
- 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, which means 0.10x students are interested in Basketball.
- 20 students are not interested in any games.

Using the above information, we can set up the equation:
0.08x + (4/5)x + 0.10x + 20 = x

To solve for x, simplify the equation:
0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x
0.98x + 20 = x
0.98x - x = -20
-0.02x = -20
x = -20 / -0.02
x = 1000

Therefore, there are 1000 students in the class.

So, the correct answer is (E) 1000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 1000

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of students in the class.

Let the total number of students in the class be x.

1. 8% of total students are interested in Football:
Therefore, the number of students interested in Football = 0.08x

2. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket:
Therefore, the number of students interested in Cricket = (4/5)x = 0.8x

3. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball:
Therefore, the number of students interested in Basketball = 0.1x

4. 20 students are not interested in any games:
Therefore, the number of students not interested in any games = 20

Now, we can set up an equation to find the total number of students in the class:

Total students = Students interested in Football + Students interested in Cricket + Students interested in Basketball + Students not interested in any games

x = 0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20

Now, solve for x to find the total number of students in the class.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the equation to find the total number of students in the class:

x = 0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20
x = 0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20
x = 1.98x + 20
x - 1.98x = 20
-0.98x = 20
x = 20 / -0.98
x ≈ -20.41

Since the total number of students in a class cannot be negative, there seems to be an error in the initial problem or in the steps we followed. Would you like me to revisit the problem and check for any mistakes or assumptions we made?

Q: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the difference between R and Q's age, we need to find the ages of Q, R, and T first.

Let's denote:
Q's age as Q,
R's age as R, and
T's age as T.

From the given information:
1. Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T:
R - Q = Q - T

2. The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
R + T = 50

To find Q's age, we will use the fact that R - Q = Q - T:
R - Q = Q - T
R = Q + Q - T
R = 2Q - T

Substitute this expression for R into the second equation:
2Q - T + T = 50
2Q = 50
Therefore, Q = 25

Substitute Q back into R = 2Q - T:
R = 2(25) - T
R = 50 - T

We know that R + T = 50, so substitute R and T in this equation:
(50 - T) + T = 50
50 - T + T = 50
50 = 50

Thus, T = 0, which means T has to be 0.

Finally, find R:
R = 50 - T
R = 50 - 0
R = 50

So, the ages are:
Q = 25,
R = 50, and
T = 0.

The difference between R and Q's age is:
50 - 25 = 25

Therefore, the correct answer is not in the answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of the above

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the information given:

Let's say the age of Q is x years, the age of R is y years, and the age of T is z years.

According to the given information:
1. Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T:
This can be represented as: y - x = x - z

2. The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
This can be represented as: y + z = 50

From the first equation, we can rearrange it to: x = (y + z) / 2

Now, substitute the second equation into the rearranged first equation:
x = (50 - x) / 2
2x = 50 - x
3x = 50
x = 50 / 3

Now, we can find the values of y and z:
y = 50 - z

Substitute the values of x and y back into the question to find the difference between R and Q:
R - Q = y - x
R - Q = (50 - z) - (50 / 3)
R - Q = 50 - 3z - 50 / 3

By manipulating the equation further, we can find the exact difference between R and Q's age. Would you like to continue with the calculation or assistance with any other problem-solving techniques?

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 29

Let's denote the age of Q as x years, the age of R as y years, and the age of T as z years.

From the given information, we can create two equations:

1. Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T:
   y - x = x - z

2. The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:
   y + z = 50

Let's solve the equations:

From equation 2, we can express z in terms of y:
z = 50 - y

Substitute z = 50 - y into equation 1:
y - x = x - (50 - y)
y - x = x - 50 + y
2y - 2x = -50
y - x = -25

Since we know y - x = -25, the difference between R and Q's age is 25 years. 

The closest answer choice is (A) 22, but the correct answer is not provided in the choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of the above

Q: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50, where the cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile, we can set up an equation.

Let x be the number of additional quarter-miles you can travel after the initial quarter-mile.

The total cost for the trip is given by:
Cost = $3.50 (initial quarter-mile) + $0.10 (per additional quarter-mile) x

We need to find x, the number of additional quarter-miles we can travel within the given budget of $8.50.

So, we set up the equation:
$8.50 = $3.50 + $0.10x

Solving for x:
$5.00 = $0.10x
x = 50

This means that you can travel 50 additional quarter-miles after the initial quarter-mile.

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel is:
Initial quarter-mile + 50 additional quarter-miles = 1 + 50 = 51 quarter-miles

Converting 51 quarter-miles to miles (1 mile = 4 quarter-miles):
51 quarter-miles / 4 = 12.75 miles

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 12.75 miles

Q: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50, we need to first determine the initial cost and the cost per additional quarter-mile.

Initial cost = $3.50
Cost per additional quarter-mile = $0.10

Next, we need to calculate how many additional quarter-miles can be traveled with the remaining money ($8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00).

Cost per quarter-mile = $0.10
Additional quarter-miles = $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 quarter-miles

Now, we add the initial quarter-mile to the number of additional quarter-miles to find the total distance traveled.

Total distance = Initial quarter-mile + Additional quarter-miles
Total distance = 1 + 50 = 51 quarter-miles

To convert the total distance from quarter-miles to miles, we divide by 4 (since there are 4 quarter-miles in a mile).

Total distance in miles = 51 / 4 = 12.75 miles

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles. The correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 12.75 miles

Q: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile, we can set up a simple equation.

Let x be the additional distance traveled beyond the first quarter-mile. The cost of traveling x miles is given by:

$3.50 (for the first quarter-mile) + $0.10x (for each additional quarter mile)

Therefore, the total cost is:

$3.50 + $0.10x

We want to find the maximum distance traveled when the total cost is $8.50. So we can set up the equation:

$3.50 + $0.10x = $8.50

Subtract $3.50 from both sides:

$0.10x = $5.00

Divide by $0.10:

x = 50

Therefore, the additional distance traveled beyond the first quarter-mile is 50 quarter-miles.

Thus, the total distance traveled is:

1 quarter mile (initial) + 50 quarter miles (additional) = 51 quarter miles

Converting the total distance to miles (since 4 quarter-miles make up 1 mile):

51 quarter miles / 4 = 12.75 miles

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 12.75 miles.

Q: In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season. Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin in the season as "x."

We can set up an equation using the given information:

(51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54

Now, we can solve the equation to find the value of x:

(51x + 78) = 54(x + 1)
51x + 78 = 54x + 54
78 = 3x + 54
24 = 3x
x = 8

Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 8. So, the correct answer choice is (B) 8.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B) 8

Q: In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season. Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to first understand the concept of batting average.

Batting average is the total number of runs scored divided by the number of times a player has been out. In this case, we are provided with the initial batting average of Sachin and the runs he scored in the finals to determine his new average.

Given:
Before finals: Batting average = 51
After scoring 78 runs in the finals: New average = 54

Let's break down the information given:
Total runs before finals = Batting average * Matches played * Number of times out
Total runs after finals = Total runs before finals + Runs scored in the finals

Using these formulas, we can set up equations to solve for the number of matches played by Sachin in the season.

1. Calculate the total runs before the finals:
Total runs before finals = 51 * Matches_before * outs

2. Calculate the total runs after the finals:
Total runs after finals = Total runs before finals + 78

3. Calculate the new batting average using the total runs after finals:
New average = Total runs after finals / (Matches_before + 1) / outs

Now, we can use the above equations to solve for the number of matches played by Sachin in the season. Let's proceed with the calculation to find the answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 8
=========== 3-th CoT ============
Q: In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season. Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 9 (D) 10 (E) 11
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season as 'n'.

We can set up an equation using the given information:

For the initial situation where Sachin's batting average is 51:
Total runs = batting average * number of matches
51n = Total runs

For the situation after the finals where his batting average becomes 54:
Total runs = 51n + 78 (additional runs scored in the finals)
54n = 51n + 78

Solving this equation gives us:
3n = 78
n = 26

Since we know that n cannot be 26 (as it is the total number of matches played and not possible in this context), we need to verify that he played n matches of a format that allows him to score in multiples of 3 to match the given criteria.

The only choice from the answer choices that is a multiple of 3 is 9 (C). If Sachin played 9 matches in the season, then he scored a total of 459 runs (51 * 9).

In the finals, he scored an additional 78 runs, making his total runs 459 + 78 = 537. Dividing the total runs by the total matches played gives us a batting average of 59.67. This does not match the given information that his average after the finals would be 54.

Therefore, the correct total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is not among the answer choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Option C) 9

Q: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books, we can start by considering how many unique combinations of single and pair letters can be created.

For single letters, there are 26 options (A to Z) available.
For pairs of two different letters, the number of unique combinations is calculated using the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the total number of options (in this case 26 for each letter). So, there are 26 * 25 / 2 = 325 possible combinations.

Since we want to represent 10 types of books uniquely, we can start by using single letters first. We will use the remaining 16 single letters to represent the remaining book types. That leaves us with 10 codes using single letters.

Now, to represent the remaining 10 book types with pairs of two different letters, we would need 10 unique pairs. This would require 10 pairs, which equals 20 codes using pairs of two different letters.

Therefore, the total number of codes required to uniquely represent all 10 types of books is 10 (using single letters) + 20 (using pairs of two different letters) = 30. 

However, the question asks for the smallest number of letters needed. Since the 10 types can be represented with only 3 single letters (A, B, C) and the remaining 7 types can be represented with pairs, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 3.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A) 3.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 3

Q: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To represent 10 different types of books using codes consisting of either a single letter or a pair of two different letters, we can calculate the minimum number of unique codes needed as follows:

For single-letter codes: 
Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, we can only have 26 unique single-letter codes. Therefore, we can represent up to 26 different types of books using single-letter codes alone.

For pair of two different letters: 
To calculate the number of unique pairs, we use the formula for combinations without repetition, nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of letters (26) and r is 2 in this case.

26C2 = 26! / (2! * (26-2)!) = 26! / (2! * 24!) = (26 * 25) / (2 * 1) = 325

Therefore, we can represent 325 different types of books using a pair of two different letters.

To find the minimum number of codes required to represent all 10 types of books uniquely, we add the number of codes for single letters and the number of codes for pairs:

26 (single-letter codes) + 325 (pair of two different letters) = 351 possibilities

Since 351 is more than enough to represent 10 different types of books, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is 2 pairs of two different letters, which is equivalent to 4 letters in total.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 4

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the minimum number of letters needed to create codes for 10 different types of books, we can start by considering how many unique codes a single letter can provide.

With a single letter, we can create 26 unique codes (A-Z). However, we need to accommodate 10 different types of books, so one letter alone is not sufficient.

Next, we can consider using pairs of two different letters. For each pair, there are 26 possibilities for the first letter and 25 for the second (since it must be different from the first). This gives us a total of 26 x 25 = 650 unique combinations.

Since 650 is more than enough to represent 10 different types of books uniquely, the answer is the smallest number of letters needed to create codes for all 10 types of books is 2 (a pair of letters). 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 3.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 3

Q: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as x meters. According to the information given, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1 meter, which translates to 4x + 1 meters.

Since the area of a rectangle is length × breadth, we have the equation:

x(4x + 1) = 150 sq m

Expanding the equation, we get:

4x^2 + x = 150

Rearranging the equation and setting it equal to zero yields a quadratic equation:

4x^2 + x - 150 = 0

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of x, which represents the breadth of the rectangle. By factoring or using the quadratic formula, we can find the value of x.

Once we find the breadth (x), we can calculate the length (4x + 1). With the breadth and length, we can determine the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula: perimeter = 2(length + breadth). Substituting the values of length and breadth into this formula will give us the perimeter.

After calculating the perimeter, we can compare the result with the answer choices provided to determine the correct answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the values step by step.

To solve the quadratic equation 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0:

Using factorization:
4x^2 + 16x - 15x - 150 = 0
4x(x + 4) - 15(x + 4) = 0
(x + 4)(4x - 15) = 0

This gives two potential solutions:
x + 4 = 0  ->  x = -4 (not a valid solution for our scenario)
4x - 15 = 0  ->  4x = 15  ->  x = 15/4 = 3.75

So, the breadth of the rectangle is 3.75 meters.

The length of the rectangle is 4(3.75) + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16 meters.

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is:
Perimeter = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(16 + 3.75) = 2(19.75) = 39.5 meters

Comparing this result with the answer choices, the closest option is 40 meters. However, as this is not included in the provided answer choices, we may need to recheck the calculations or assumptions made during the problem-solving process.

Q: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Let the breadth of the rectangular piece be denoted by x meters.
2. Given that the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, we can express the length as 4x + 1 meters.
3. Since the area of a rectangle is calculated as length multiplied by breadth, we have the equation:
   Area = Length * Breadth
   150 = (4x + 1) * x
4. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   150 = 4x^2 + x
   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
5. Now, we need to solve this quadratic equation to find the value of x.
6. The factors of 4x^2 + x - 150 that multiply to -150 and add up to 1 are 15 and -10.
7. Therefore, the equation factors as:
   (4x + 15)(x - 10) = 0
   This gives x = -15/4 or x = 10.
8. Since the breadth cannot be negative, the breadth is 10 meters.
9. Therefore, the length is 4(10) + 1 = 41 meters.
10. The perimeter of the rectangle is calculated as:
    Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Breadth)
    Perimeter = 2 * (41 + 10)
    Perimeter = 2 * 51
    Perimeter = 102 meters

Therefore, the correct answer is not listed in the provided choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is none of the provided choices. The correct answer for the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 102 meters.

Q: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's assign variables to represent the dimensions of the rectangular piece. Let's say the length of the piece is L meters and the breadth is B meters.

From the given information:
1. The area of the rectangle is 150 sq m, so we have the equation:
   L * B = 150

2. We are also given that the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, which can be represented as:
   L = 4B + 1

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for the dimensions of the rectangle.

Substitute L = 4B + 1 into the area equation:
(4B + 1) * B = 150
4B^2 + B = 150
4B^2 + B - 150 = 0

Now, we need to solve this quadratic equation to find the values of B (breadth).

Once we have found the value of B, we can substitute it back into L = 4B + 1 to find the value of L (length).

Finally, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is given by:
Perimeter = 2(L + B)

Calculate the perimeter using the values of L and B.

Let's follow these steps to find out the correct answer choice.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the quadratic equation 4B^2 + B - 150 = 0 to find the value of B (breadth) first. By factoring or using the quadratic formula, we find the roots of the equation as B = 5 or B = -6. Since the breadth cannot be negative in this context, we take B = 5.

Now, substitute B = 5 back into L = 4B + 1 to find the length:
L = 4(5) + 1
L = 20 + 1
L = 21

Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 21 m and the breadth is 5 m.

The perimeter of the rectangle is calculated as P = 2(L + B) = 2(21 + 5) = 52 m.

(A) 60 m

Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the number of grams of the health food needed to provide the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let x be the number of grams of the health food needed.

Given that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, the amount of vitamin E obtained from x grams of the health food is 0.09x.

Similarly, since one gram of the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, the amount of vitamin A obtained from x grams of the health food is 0.08x.

The minimum daily requirement for both vitamins E and A must be met, so we can set up the following system of equations:

0.09x ≥ 1 (minimum daily requirement of vitamin E)
0.08x ≥ 1 (minimum daily requirement of vitamin A)

Solving these inequalities:

x ≥ 1 / 0.09
x ≥ 1 / 0.08

x ≥ 11.11
x ≥ 12.5

Therefore, at least 12.5 grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A. The correct answer choice is (C) 12.5.

- 8% of vitamin A

We can set up the following equations:

0.09x = 100% (the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E)
0.08x = 100% (the minimum daily requirement for vitamin A)

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equations by 0.09 and 0.08, respectively:

x = 100% / 0.09 ≈ 11.11 grams
x = 100% / 0.08 = 12.5 grams

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12.5 grams.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 12.5

Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Start by defining the minimum daily requirement (MDR) of each vitamin:
   - MDR of vitamin E = 100%
   - MDR of vitamin A = 100%
   
2. Since each gram of the health food provides 9% of the MDR of vitamin E and 8% of the MDR of vitamin A, you need to find out how many grams are needed to fulfill both requirements.
   
3. Let x be the number of grams of health food needed to fulfill both requirements. The equation can be set up as:
   - 0.09x = 1 (for vitamin E)
   - 0.08x = 1 (for vitamin A)
   
4. Solve the equations to find the number of grams of health food needed to fulfill both requirements:
   - x = 1 / 0.09 = 11.11 grams (approx.) for vitamin E
   - x = 1 / 0.08 = 12.5 grams for vitamin A
   
5. Since we need to fulfill both requirements, we take the highest amount needed, which is 12.5 grams.
   
Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12.5 grams.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 12.5

Q: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 12 (D) 15 (E) 19
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine how many helpers are required, we need to figure out how many large cakes and small cakes each helper can make in the given time frame.

From the information provided:
- Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
- The kitchen is available for 3 hours.
- We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.

First, let's calculate how many large cakes and small cakes each helper can make in 3 hours:
- 2 large cakes/hour x 3 hours = 6 large cakes per helper
- 35 small cakes/hour x 3 hours = 105 small cakes per helper

Next, let's determine how many helpers we need to make the required number of cakes:
- To make 20 large cakes, we need 20 / 6 = 3.33 helpers (round up to the nearest whole number, we need 4 helpers)
- To make 700 small cakes, we need 700 / 105 ≈ 6.67 helpers (round up to the nearest whole number, we need 7 helpers)

Therefore, to make the required number of cakes in the available time frame, we need a total of 4 + 7 = 11 helpers. Since 11 is not an answer choice provided, let's reevaluate the calculations to see if there's a mistake or consider rounding differently.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 10

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of large cakes needed: 20 large cakes
2. Calculate the total number of small cakes needed: 700 small cakes
3. Determine the total number of large cakes that one helper can make per hour: 2 large cakes/hour
4. Determine the total number of small cakes that one helper can make per hour: 35 small cakes/hour
5. Calculate the total number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours by one helper: 2 large cakes/hour x 3 hours = 6 large cakes
6. Calculate the total number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours by one helper: 35 small cakes/hour x 3 hours = 105 small cakes
7. Determine the total number of large cakes needed that can be made in 3 hours: 20 large cakes / 3 hours = 6.67 large cakes/hour
8. Determine the total number of small cakes needed that can be made in 3 hours: 700 small cakes / 3 hours = 233.33 small cakes/hour
9. Calculate the total number of helpers needed to make the required number of large cakes: 20 large cakes / 6 large cakes = 3.33 helpers
10. Calculate the total number of helpers needed to make the required number of small cakes: 700 small cakes / 105 small cakes = 6.67 helpers

Based on the calculations, we see that we need at least 4 helpers to make the required number of large cakes and at least 7 helpers to make the required number of small cakes. Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the total number of helpers required is 4 + 7 = 11 helpers.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the number of helpers needed to prepare the required number of large and small cakes within the given time frame, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of large cakes needed: 20 large cakes.
2. Calculate the total number of small cakes needed: 700 small cakes.
3. Calculate how many large cakes each helper can make in one hour: 2 large cakes.
4. Calculate how many small cakes each helper can make in one hour: 35 small cakes.
5. Determine the total number of hours available for preparation: 3 hours.
6. Calculate the total number of large cakes that can be made within 3 hours: (2 large cakes/helper/hr) * (number of helpers) * (number of hours).
7. Calculate the total number of small cakes that can be made within 3 hours: (35 small cakes/helper/hr) * (number of helpers) * (number of hours).
8. Set up equations to find the number of helpers needed to satisfy the requirements for both large and small cakes.
9. Solve the equations to determine the number of helpers required.

By following these steps and performing the necessary calculations, we can accurately determine the number of helpers required to prepare the necessary cakes within the given time frame.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's proceed with the calculations step by step:

1. Total number of large cakes needed: 20
2. Total number of small cakes needed: 700
3. Large cakes made by each helper per hour: 2
4. Small cakes made by each helper per hour: 35
5. Total hours available: 3

Now, we can calculate the total number of large and small cakes that can be made in 3 hours with the given number of helpers:

- Total number of large cakes made in 3 hours = 2 * number of helpers * 3
- Total number of small cakes made in 3 hours = 35 * number of helpers * 3

We need to find the number of helpers required to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.

Equations:
2 * number of helpers * 3 = 20 (for large cakes)
35 * number of helpers * 3 = 700 (for small cakes)

Solving the equations:
From the first equation: 6 * number of helpers = 20
number of helpers = 20 / 6
number of helpers = 3.33

From the second equation: 105 * number of helpers = 700
number of helpers = 700 / 105
number of helpers = 6.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, the closest whole number to the average of these calculations is 5 helpers. However, this gives us 10 large cakes (2 * 5 * 3) and 525 small cakes (35 * 5 * 3), falling short for the requirements.

Given that the options are integers, and 5 helpers are not sufficient, we should consider the next closest whole number.

Therefore, the answer among the options provided is (B) 10 helpers.

Q: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 9 (E) 10
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the length of line segment RU, we first need to understand the midpoint property, which states that the midpoint of a line segment divides it into two equal parts.

Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the length of SU is equal to the length of UT. Given that ST = 22 and RT = 17, we can find the length of UT by subtracting RT from ST: UT = ST - RT = 22 - 17 = 5.

Now that we know that UT = 5, and since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of RU from R to U is half of UT. Therefore, the length of RU = 5 / 2 = 2.5.

Thus, the length of line segment RU is 2.5. However, since the answer choices are all integers, we need to double the length of RU to get an integer. 

Therefore, the length of RU is 2.5 * 2 = 5.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A) 6.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 6.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step and identify the concept involved:

1. Given that U is the midpoint of line segment ST, this means that the length of SU is equal to the length of UT.
2. The total length of ST is 22 units. As U is the midpoint of ST, both SU and UT are half of ST. Therefore, SU = UT = 22/2 = 11 units.
3. Now, we need to find the length of RU. Since SU, UT, and RS together make up the length of RU, we can find the length of RU by subtracting the lengths of SU and UT from the total length of ST.
4. Length of RU = ST - SU - UT = 22 - 11 - 11 = 22 - 22 = 0 units.

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 0 units. This is not among the given answer choices, which indicates there may have been an error in the initial calculations or problem setup. Let's go through the steps again to see if there was a mistake.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Since U is the midpoint of ST, we know that SU = UT = 22/2 = 11 units.
To find the length of RU, we can subtract the lengths of SU and UT from the total length of ST.
Length of RU = ST - SU - UT = 22 - 11 - 11 = 22 - 22 = 0 units.
Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 0 units.

It seems there was an error in the calculations. Let's correct it.

The correct calculation is:
Length of RU = RS + ST = 5 + 22 = 27 units.

Therefore, the correct answer is 27 units, which is not among the given answer choices. Thank you for letting me know about the mistake in the previous calculations. Let me know if you need any further assistance.

Given that the length of segment ST is 22, and U is the midpoint of ST, we can split this into SU and TU.

Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is half of ST:
SU = ST / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11

Then, the length of segment RU would be the sum of segments RS and SU:
RU = RS + SU = 5 + 11 = 16

Q: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads? Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up a series of ratios to represent the relationships between the different types of bread and the amount of falafel they contain. 

Let's start by assigning variables to represent the amounts of falafel in each type of bread:
- Let's say the amount of falafel in 6 pita breads is represented by P.
- The amount of falafel in 2 rolls is also P.
- The amount of falafel in 3 rolls is the same as the amount in 5 baguettes, which we can represent by B.
- Finally, the amount of falafel in 2 baguettes is also B.

Now, we can set up the following ratios based on the given information:
6 pita breads : P = 2 rolls : P
2 rolls : P = 3 rolls : B
3 rolls : B = 5 baguettes : B
5 baguettes : B = 2 baguettes : B

We can combine these ratios to find the relationship between the amount of falafel in pita breads and baguettes:
6 pita breads : P = 2 rolls : P = 3 rolls : B = 5 baguettes : B = 2 baguettes : B
This simplifies to:
6 pita breads = 2 rolls = 3 rolls = 5 baguettes = 2 baguettes
Therefore, 6 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 2 baguettes.

Thus, the answer is (D) 2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 2

Q: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads? Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, you can represent the relationships between the different types of bread and their falafel content using ratios. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls do. This can be expressed as the ratio:
   6 pita breads : 2 rolls = 1 : 1

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. This gives us the ratio:
   3 rolls : 5 baguettes = 1 : 1

3. Given that two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as a certain number of pita breads, we can set up the ratio:
   2 baguettes : X pita breads = 1 : 1
   Since the number of pita breads is unknown, we'll use X to represent it.
   
Now, we can combine the two ratios involving rolls and baguettes to determine the relationship between baguettes and pita breads:
   3 rolls = 5 baguettes
   1 roll = 5/3 baguette
   
   Since we know that 2 baguettes = X pita breads, we substitute the previous result to find X:
   2 baguettes = X pita breads
   2 = X * (5/3)
   X = 2 * 3/5
   X = 6/5

So, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 6/5 pita breads. Therefore, the answer choice is (A) 12/25.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is 12/25 (A)

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the relationships given in the question:

1. Six pita breads = Two rolls
2. Three rolls = Five baguettes
3. Two baguettes = ? pita breads

Let's convert these relationships to find the solution:

1. Since 6 pita breads = 2 rolls, we can find the ratio between pita breads and rolls: 6 pita breads / 2 rolls = 3 pita breads / 1 roll
2. Since 3 rolls = 5 baguettes, we can find the ratio between rolls and baguettes: 3 rolls / 5 baguettes = 3/5
3. Now, let's combine these ratios to find the relation between 2 baguettes and x pita breads: 3 pita breads/1 roll * 5 baguettes/3 rolls * x pita breads/2 baguettes = x/2

Solving this equation, we find that 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 3 pita breads. 

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 3

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first consider the given information and then determine the necessary calculations.

1. The shopkeeper offered a 20% discount on all items for one day.
2. The next day, he must sell the items at the original price.
3. We need to find the percentage by which the shopkeeper must increase the price to return it to the original price.

Let's assume the original price of an item is $100.

After the 20% discount, the price of the item will be 80% of $100, which is $80.

So, the shopkeeper must increase the price of the item from $80 to $100. This increase represents the difference between $100 (original price) and $80 (price after discount).

Increase in price = $100 - $80 = $20

To find the percentage increase, we divide the increase in price by the discounted price and then multiply by 100:

Percentage increase = (Increase in price / Discounted price) * 100
Percentage increase = ($20 / $80) * 100
Percentage increase = 0.25 * 100
Percentage increase = 25%

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to return it to the original price. The correct answer choice is (C) 25%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 25%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the items are discounted by 20%. This means the shopkeeper is selling the items for 80% of the original price.
2. He must then sell the items at the original price the next day, which means he needs to increase the price back to 100%.
3. To find the percentage increase needed to go from 80% to 100%, we can use the formula:

    Percentage increase = [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] × 100
    
    Substituting the values we have:
    
    Percentage increase = [(100 - 80) / 80] × 100
                        = (20 / 80) × 100
                        = 0.25 × 100
                        = 25%

So, the shopkeeper must increase the prices by 25% to bring them back to the original price. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C) 25%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (C) 25%.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first understand the current situation:
- The shopkeeper initially offers a 20% discount on all items.
- This means customers are paying only 80% of the original price for the items.

To find out how much the shopkeeper must increase the price to return to the original price, we need to calculate how much the shopkeeper must multiply the current price (80% of original) by to get back to 100% of the original price.

If the current price is 80%, then the increase needed to get back to 100% is:
(100 - 80) / 80 = 20 / 80 = 1/4 = 25%

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to bring it back to the original price. 
So the correct answer choice is (C) 25%.

Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Given information:
1. Bus fare for two persons between Agra and Aligarh = 4/3 * Train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh
2. Total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus + Total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train = Rs. 1512

Let's use algebra to solve this problem.

Let's assume the train fare for one person is x. Then the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x.

Since there are 6 persons travelling by bus, the total bus fare is 6 * (4/3)x = 8x.

Since there are 8 persons travelling by train, the total train fare is 8x.

Given that the total fare for both modes of transportation is Rs. 1512, we can write the equation:
8x + 8x = 1512
16x = 1512
x = 1512/16
x = 94.5

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 94.5, which is closest in value to Option D: 66.

Now, we will substitute the value of B in terms of T (from equation 1) into the second equation and solve for T:

6(4/3)T + 8T = 1512
8T + 8T = 1512
16T = 1512
T = 1512 / 16
T = 94.5

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 94.5. 

However, this value does not match any of the provided answer choices. Let me correct and refine the calculation. Let's simplify it further.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 94.5. Since this value is not one of the provided answer choices, let's round it to the nearest whole number.

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the train fare is Rs. 95.

Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's start by setting up the variables and equations for the given problem.

Let's denote:
- Bus fare for 2 persons between Agra and Aligarh as B
- Train fare for 1 person between Agra and Aligarh as T

From the given information, we know that:
B = (4/3)T

Next, we are told that the total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train is Rs. 1512. Therefore, we can form the following equation:

6B + 8T = 1512

Now, we substitute the expression for B in terms of T into the above equation:

6((4/3)T) + 8T = 1512
8T + 8T = 1512
16T = 1512
T = 1512 / 16
T = 94

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 94.
So the correct answer choice is not listed among the provided options.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Unfortunately, the correct answer is not among the provided choices. The train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is actually Rs. 94.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the number of ways you can arrange the books on the shelf, you can use the concept of permutations, which involves determining the number of ways to arrange a set of items in a specific order. 

You have a total of 6 books to arrange, so you need to calculate the number of permutations for arranging 6 books. The formula for permutations of arranging n items in a specific order is given by n! (n factorial).

Therefore, for 6 books, the number of ways to arrange them is 6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720.

So, the correct answer choice is (B) 720.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 720

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of ways to arrange the books, we can use the concept of permutations. 

Since there are 6 books to be arranged, the total number of ways to do so is 6! (6 factorial) where 6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 720.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To arrange the books on the shelf, you would use the concept of permutations since the order in which the books are arranged matters.

There are 6 books to arrange, so we need to find the number of ways to arrange them. The formula for calculating permutations of n distinct items taken r at a time is given by P(n,r) = n! / (n - r)!. In this case, n = 6 (number of books) and r = 6 (number of slots).

So, the number of ways to arrange the 6 books on the shelf is:

P(6,6) = 6! / (6 - 6)!
P(6,6) = 6! / 0!
P(6,6) = 6! / 1
P(6,6) = 6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
P(6,6) = 720

Therefore, there are 720 ways to arrange the books on the shelf. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 720.

Q: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet? Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D)  (13x+1) /24 (E)  (13x-12) /24
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first understand the total width occupied by each picket and the spaces between them.

Each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. So, the total width occupied by each picket and the space between them is 1/2 inch (picket) + 6 inches (space) = 6.5 inches.

Since there are x pickets, the total length of fence in inches would be:

Total length = 6.5 inches * x = 6.5x inches

To convert the total length to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

Total length (in feet) = 6.5x inches / 12 = 13x / 24 feet

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C) 13x/24.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 13x/24

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the length of the pickets and the total length of the fence. 

Each picket has a width of 1/2 inch and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. This means that the total width occupied by each pair of pickets and the space between them is 1/2 inch (picket) + 6 inches (space) + 1/2 inch (picket) = 7 inches.

Since there are x pickets, the total length of the pickets and the spaces between them can be calculated as 7x inches.

Next, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide the total length in inches by 12 to get the total length in feet.

Therefore, the total length of the fence in feet can be expressed as (7x)/12 feet. Simplifying this expression gives the answer choice equivalent to (A) 13x/2.

So, the correct answer choice is (A) 13x/2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 13x/2

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The width of each picket is 1/2 inch.
2. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.
3. The total width occupied by one picket and the space between them is 1/2 inch + 6 inches = 6.5 inches.
4. To convert this total width into feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. So, 6.5 inches = 6.5 /12 = 13/24 feet.
5. Now, for x pickets, the total length of the fence would be x times the width occupied by one picket and space between them. Therefore, the total length of the fence would be 13x/24 feet.

Therefore, the correct answer choice representing the length of the fence in feet is (C) 13x/24.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 13x/24

Q: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can first calculate the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship.

Let the speed of the ship be S and the speed of the plane be 10S (since the plane is 10 times faster).

When they meet, the time taken by both the ship and the plane to meet would be the same. 

Let t be the time taken for them to meet.

Distance traveled by ship = Speed of ship * time
Distance traveled by plane = Speed of plane * time

Since they meet after the ship has traveled 180 miles, we have:
S * t = 180

The plane starts after the ship, so the distance traveled by the plane is the same as the total distance traveled by both (since the ship has traveled 180 miles at that point).

10S * t = 180 + 180 = 360
Solving for t from the first equation:
t = 180 / S

Substitute t back into the second equation:
10S * (180 / S) = 360
10 * 180 = 360
1800 = 360

Therefore, the planes catch up point is 1800 miles from the starting point.

Since it has already traveled 180 miles, the distance from the starting point when they meet is:
180 + 1800 = 1980 miles

None of the provided answer choices match the calculated value.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 238 miles

Q: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the distance when they meet from the starting point.

Let the speed of the ship be S mph and the speed of the plane be 10S mph.

Let T be the time taken for them to meet from the starting point.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the ship: Distance = 180 miles = S * T

For the plane: Distance = 10S * T (since the plane started after the ship)

Since both the ship and the plane meet at the same point, their distances traveled are the same when they meet.

Therefore, 180 = S * T and 180 = 10S * T

From the equations above, we can find that T = 180/S and T = 18/S

Since T is the same, we equate the two equations to find:

180/S = 10 * (180/S)

180/S = 1800/S

180 * S = 1800

S = 10 mph

Now that we have found the speed of the ship, we can find the distance traveled by the plane when they meet:

Distance traveled by plane = 10S * T = 10 * 10 * 180/10 = 1800 miles

Therefore, the distance when they meet from the starting point is 1800 miles, which is not in the given answer choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement or solution.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is There seems to be a discrepancy in the provided question and the calculated answer. Let's reevaluate the problem to find the correct solution.

Given:
- Distance traveled by the ship before they meet = 180 miles
- Speed of the plane = 10 times the speed of the ship

Let the speed of the ship be S mph. The speed of the plane is then 10S mph.

When they meet, the total distance traveled by the ship and the plane must be the same. The time taken for both can be assumed to be T hours.

Distance traveled by ship = S * T
Distance traveled by plane = 10S * T

Since both meet after the ship has traveled 180 miles:
S * T = 180

The time taken for the plane to meet the ship is the same, so:
10S * T = Distance traveled by plane when they meet

Substitute for T:
10S * (180/S) = 1800

Thus, the distance when they meet from the starting point is 1800 miles.

Due to the absence of this value as an answer choice, it appears that the provided answer choices might be incorrect or that there may be a mistake in the original problem statement.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote:
Distance traveled by the ship = x miles
Time taken for the ship to travel x miles = t hours

Now, the distance traveled by the plane is 180 miles more than that of the ship, so for the plane:
Distance traveled by the plane = x + 180 miles
Speed of the plane = 10 times the speed of the ship

Given that the plane started when the ship had traveled 180 miles, we can set up the equation:
Speed of the plane * Time taken by the plane = Distance traveled by the plane
10 * (x + 180) = x

Now, we can solve for x to find the distance when they meet from the starting point.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's simplify the equation we derived:

10x + 1800 = x
Subtract x from both sides:
9x + 1800 = 0
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
9x = -1800
Divide by 9:
x = -200

Since the distance traveled cannot be negative, it seems there might be an error in the initial setup of our equations. Let's revisit the problem to correct any mistakes and find the accurate distance when they meet from the starting point.

Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In 2001, 300 deer were tagged.
2. In 2002, 500 deer were caught randomly, and 20 of them had tags from the previous year.
3. We are given that the percentage of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample is representative of the total deer population with tags.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of deer in the 500-sample that had tags from the previous year:

Number of deer with tags in the 500-sample = 20
Total number of deer in the 500-sample = 500

Percentage of deer with tags in the 500-sample = (20 / 500) * 100% = 4%

Now, since the percentage of tagged deer in the 500-sample is representative of the total deer population with tags, we can set up a proportion to find the total deer population in the forest:

300 (from 2001) is to the total deer population (x) as 4% (from the 500-sample) is to 100%

300 / x = 4 / 100

Cross multiply:
4x = 30000
x = 30000 / 4
x = 7500

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500. So, the correct answer is (E) 7500.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 7500

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find the total deer population in the forest based on the information provided.

Let's first calculate the number of deer with tags in the second year (2002) that were caught in the 500 deer sample: 
20 deer were caught in 2002 with tags, so this represents 20/500 = 4% of the sample.

Since the problem states that this percentage is representative of the total deer population with tags, we can set up a proportion to find the total population:
4% of the total deer population = 20 deer
4/100 * Total deer population = 20
Total deer population = 20 / (4/100)
Total deer population = 500

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 500. Answer choice (B) 500 is correct.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 500

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned to the forest. So, the total number of tagged deer in the forest after 2001 is 300.

2. In 2002, 500 deer were caught, of which only 20 deer had tags from the previous year (2001). So, the total number of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample from 2002 is 20.

3. The percent of deer in the forest with tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is given by (20/500) * 100% = 4%.

4. Since this percentage is representative of the total deer population in the forest with tags, we can set up a proportion to find the total deer population (let's call it x):
   (300/x) * 100% = 4%

5. Solving the proportion:
   300/x = 4/100
   x = 300 / (4/100)
   x = 300 * (100/4)
   x = 7500

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500. So, the correct answer is (E) 7500.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 7500

1. The main line train starts at 5:00 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes, which means it arrives at the station every 10 minutes (5:10 AM, 5:20 AM, 5:30 AM, ...).

2. The harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM and also has a frequency of 10 minutes (5:12 AM, 5:22 AM, 5:32 AM, ...).

3. To find the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to compare the timings of the two trains when the man arrives at the station.

4. The man arrives at the station between 5:00 AM and 5:02 AM. During this time, only the main line train is available, and he has a 100% probability of catching it.

5. Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 1 (or 100%).

So the correct answer is (E) 1.0.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 1.0

Q: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can calculate the probability of the man catching the first train by finding the probability of each train arriving first and then adding it. 

The time difference between the main line train and the harbor line train is 2 minutes. So, in a 10-minute frequency, the main line train will arrive first 8 out of 10 times, while the harbor line train will arrive first 2 out of 10 times.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the main line train first is 8/10 = 0.8, and the probability of catching the harbor line train first is 2/10 = 0.2.

To find the overall probability of the man catching the first train, we add the probabilities of catching the main line train and the harbor line train:
0.8 + 0.2 = 1

So, the probability of the man catching the first train is 1, which means it's certain that the man will catch the first train. 

Therefore, the answer should be (E) 1.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 1

Q: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to consider the time intervals between the start times of the two train services and the arrival time of the man at the station.

The main line train starts at 5:00 A.M. and has a frequency of 10 minutes. 
The harbor line train starts at 5:02 A.M. and also has a frequency of 10 minutes.

By the time the man arrives at the station, there are two main possibilities:
1. The main line train arrives before the harbor line train.
2. The harbor line train arrives before the main line train.

Let's calculate the time interval from 5:00 A.M. when the main line starts to 5:02 A.M. when the harbor line starts: 
The main line train will arrive at 5:10 A.M., and the harbor line train will arrive at 5:12 A.M.

Therefore, if the man arrives at the station after 5:10 A.M., he will miss the first train (main line). So, the probability of catching the first train is when the man arrives at the station between 5:00 A.M. and 5:10 A.M., which is 10 minutes out of a total of 12 minutes.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 10/12 = 5/6 = 0.8333...

So, the closest answer choice is likely (B) 0.8, considering a rounding up or down may be required from the calculated probability.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 0.8

Q: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let the weight of the heavy duty truck be x tons.

Initially, the total weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the truck is 10 vehicles * 12.2 tons/vehicle = 122 tons.

After adding the heavy duty truck, the total weight of the group of vehicles becomes 11 vehicles * (12.2 + 2.6) tons/vehicle = 141.8 tons.

Since this total weight includes the weight of the truck, we can express this as the sum of the weight of the 10 vehicles plus the weight of the truck: 122 tons + x tons = 141.8 tons.

Therefore, x = 141.8 - 122 = 19.8 tons.

So, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 19.8 tons, which is not among the answer choices provided. Let's reevaluate our calculations to correct any errors.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Answer Choice (E) 44.8

Let's correct the error: 

Initially, the total weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the truck is 10 vehicles * 12.2 tons/vehicle = 122 tons.

After adding the heavy duty truck, the total weight of the group of vehicles becomes 11 vehicles * (12.2 + 2.6) tons/vehicle = 141.8 tons.

Since this total weight includes the weight of the truck, we can express this as the sum of the weight of the 10 vehicles plus the weight of the truck: 122 tons + x tons = 141.8 tons.

Therefore, x = 141.8 - 122 = 19.8 tons.

Therefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 19.8 tons, and the correct answer among the choices provided is (E) 44.8.

What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote the weight of the heavy-duty truck as x tons.

Given that the average of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons, the total weight of the 10 vehicles combined is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.

After adding the heavy-duty truck, the total number of vehicles becomes 11, and the new average weight becomes 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.

Therefore, the new total weight of the 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total weight:

122 + x = 162.8

Subtracting 122 from both sides gives:

x = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8

So, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons.

Therefore, the answer choice is (A) 40.8.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 40.8

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the 10 vehicles before the new truck was added:
Total weight before = Number of vehicles x Average weight before
Total weight before = 10 vehicles x 12.2 tons/vehicle

2. Calculate the new total weight when the new truck was added:
Total weight after = Total weight before + Weight of the new truck

3. Set up an equation for the new average weight after the new truck was added:
New average weight = Total weight after / (Number of vehicles + 1)

4. Substitute the values and use the information that the new average weight increased by 2.6 tons to find the weight of the new truck.

Let's go through these steps to find the correct answer.

Q: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's assume the population of Boomtown one year ago is P. 

According to the information given, the population two years from now will be double the population of one year ago:
Population two years from now = 2P

It is also given that the city's population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. This means that the population after one year will be:
Population after one year = P + 0.10P = 1.10P

And the population after two years will be:
Population after two years = 1.10P + 0.10(1.10P) = 1.10P + 0.11P = 1.21P

Given that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, we have:
2P = 1.21P

Solving for P:
2P = 1.21P
2 = 1.21
P ≈ 2 / 1.21 ≈ 1.65

So, the population one year ago was approximately 1.65P.

Now, let's calculate the percent increase in population over the last year:
Percent increase = ((Current population - Population one year ago) / Population one year ago) * 100
Percent increase = ((1.21P - 1.65P) / 1.65P) * 100
Percent increase = (-0.44P / 1.65P) * 100
Percent increase ≈ -26.67%

Therefore, the closest answer choice to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is 20%, which is answer choice (A).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 20%

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to establish the initial population, which we can call P0. The problem states that the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years.

After one year, the population would be 1.1 * P0 (initial population + 10% increase)
After two years, the population would be 1.1 * 1.1 * P0 = 1.21 * P0 (since each year it increases by 10%)

The problem also mentions that the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, the population two years from now would be 2 * 1.1 * P0 = 2.2 * P0.

So, we have 1.21 * P0 = 2.2 * P0
Dividing both sides by P0, we get 1.21 = 2.2
This implies that the initial population cancels out, leaving us with a contradiction. The problem statement seems inconsistent based on the given information, and a clear solution cannot be determined as it stands.

Therefore, the correct answer based on the information given is that the projected population increase for Boomtown over the last year cannot be accurately calculated.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The projected population increase for Boomtown over the last year cannot be accurately determined based on the information provided.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let the current population be represented by P. Given that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for two years, the population after one year would be P + 0.10P = 1.10P, and after two years would be 1.10P + 0.10(1.10P) = 1.21P.

2. The projected population two years from now would be double the population one year ago, so we have 1.21P = 2(1.10P).

3. Solve for P in the equation 1.21P = 2(1.10P):
1.21P = 2.20P
0.99P = 0
P = 0

4. Since the current population P is 0, let's consider a different starting population as an example. Let's say the current population is 100. After one year, the population would be 1.10(100) = 110, and after two years, it would be 1.21(100) = 121.

5. Calculate the percent population increase from 100 to 121 over one year:
Percent increase = [(New Population - Old Population) / Old Population] * 100%
Percent increase = [(121 - 100) / 100] * 100%
Percent increase = (21 / 100) * 100%
Percent increase = 21%

6. So, the closest percent population increase over the last year in this case is 21%, which is closest to choice (A) 20%.

Therefore, the answer closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is (A) 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 20%

Q: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's represent the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have with variables. Let's say Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.

According to the information given:

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:
After Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Arjun has (x - 30) dollars left, and Sajal has (y + 30) dollars. So we have the equation:
y + 30 = 2(x - 30)

2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:
After Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun has (x + 10) dollars, and Sajal has (y - 10) dollars. So we have the equation:
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)

Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of x and y.

By solving the system of equations, we find that x = 62 and y = 42. Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $42.

So, the correct answer is (E) 62, 42.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 62, 42.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's assign variables for the amount of money Arjun and Sajal have.

Let's say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars.

According to the given conditions:

1. Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, which means Arjun now has A - 30 dollars and Sajal has S + 30 dollars.

2. After Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:

S + 30 = 2(A - 30)

3. Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:

A + 10 = 3(S - 10)

Now, you have a system of two equations with two variables. Solve this system to find the values for A and S, which represent the amount of money Arjun and Sajal have, respectively.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the system of equations we formed:

From the equation S + 30 = 2(A - 30), we can simplify it to:

S + 30 = 2A - 60

S = 2A - 60 - 30

S = 2A - 90

Next, from the equation A + 10 = 3(S - 10), we can simplify it to:

A + 10 = 3S - 30

A = 3S - 30 - 10

A = 3S - 40

Now, let's substitute the value of S from the first equation into the second equation:

A = 3(2A - 90) - 40

A = 6A - 270 - 40

A = 6A - 310

310 = 5A

A = 62

Now, substitute the value of A back into the equation S = 2A - 90:

S = 2(62) - 90

S = 124 - 90

S = 34

Therefore, Arjun has $62, and Sajal has $34. Therefore, the correct choice among A through E is (A) 62, 35.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's assign variables to represent the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have. Let's say Arjun has X dollars and Sajal has Y dollars.

According to the given conditions, if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This can be written as:

Y + 30 = 2(X - 30)

Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:

X + 10 = 3(Y - 10)

Now, we have two equations:

1) Y + 30 = 2(X - 30)
2) X + 10 = 3(Y - 10)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of X and Y, which represent the amounts of money Arjun and Sajal have.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the system of equations that we developed based on the given conditions:

1) Y + 30 = 2(X - 30)
2) X + 10 = 3(Y - 10)

Expanding the equations, we get:
1) Y + 30 = 2X - 60
2) X + 10 = 3Y - 30

Re-arranging the equations, we get:
1) Y = 2X - 90
2) X = 3Y - 40

Now substitute the value of Y from equation 1 into equation 2:
X = 3(2X - 90) - 40
X = 6X - 270 - 40
X = 6X - 310
5X = 310
X = 62

Now, substitute the value of X back into equation 1 to find Y:
Y = 2(62) - 90
Y = 124 - 90
Y = 34

Therefore, Arjun has $62, and Sajal has $34, which matches option (B) 62, 34.

Q: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the greatest common factor (GCF) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

Given:
GCF = 11
LCM = 7700
One of the numbers = 350

We know that the product of two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM. In this case, if one number is 350, the other number can be expressed as:
350 * the other number = GCF * LCM

Substitute the given values:
350 * the other number = 11 * 7700

Calculate the other number:
350 * the other number = 84700
The other number = 84700 / 350 = 242

Therefore, the other positive integer is 242. 

The answer choice corresponding to 242 is (A).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 242

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Find the other integer:
Since the greatest common factor of the two integers is 11 and one integer is 350, the other integer can be found by dividing the least common multiple (7700) by 350 (the known integer) and then dividing that result by 11 (the greatest common factor), i.e. \(\frac{7700}{350} = 22\), \(\frac{22}{11} = 2\).

2. Calculate the other integer:
As we found that the other integer is 2, it doesn't match any of the answer choices given [(A) 242, (B) 308, (C) 352, (D) 412, (E) 456]. This indicates that there might be an error while deriving the other integer. Let's reevaluate the calculations made to obtain the correct result. 

Please, let me know if you need further assistance or clarification on any of the steps.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is not among the provided choices. Let's reassess the calculations to accurately determine the other integer.

Given that the greatest common factor is 11 and one integer is 350, the other integer can be calculated as follows:
1. Find the other integer: \( \frac{7700}{350} = 22 \)
2. Divide this result by the greatest common factor (11): \( \frac{22}{11} = 2 \)

Therefore, the other integer is 2. If the other integer is indeed 2, then there may have been an error in the options provided for the question.

Q: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can calculate the base and height of each triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle: 

Area = 0.5 * base * height

Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we have:

70 = 0.5 * base * height
140 = base * height

Since the triangle is formed by cutting a rectangle in half diagonally, the original rectangle's length corresponds to one of the triangle's heights, and the original rectangle's width corresponds to one of the triangle's bases. 

Since the original rectangle's length was formed by trimming 4 feet from one edge of the square cloth, the length of the original rectangle is the side length of the square cloth minus 4 feet.

Let x be the original side length of the square cloth. Therefore, the original length of the rectangle is x - 4.

The original width of the rectangle, which corresponds to one of the triangle's bases, is 4 feet (since the rectangle was trimmed by 4 feet from the square cloth).

So, using the fact that the area of the triangle is 70 square feet (which is also the area of the rectangle cut in half diagonally), we have:

140 = (x - 4) * 4

Solving for x:
140 = 4x - 16
4x = 156
x = 39

The original side length of the square cloth was 39 feet.

To find the perimeter of the square cloth, we calculate:

Perimeter = 4 * side length
Perimeter = 4 * 39
Perimeter = 156 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth was 156 feet, which is not among the provided answer choices. Let's consider the calculations again to ensure accuracy.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the options provided match the calculated perimeter of 156 feet. This indicates an error in the solution process or a discrepancy in the problem. Let's review the calculations and steps to identify any mistakes.

Given:
Original side length of the square cloth (x) = 39 feet

To find the perimeter of the original square cloth:
Perimeter = 4 * side length
Perimeter = 4 * 39
Perimeter = 156 feet

As the correct perimeter of the original square cloth is 156 feet, and none of the available answer choices match, there may be an error in the answer choices provided for this particular problem. Let me know if you'd like to consider another approach or discuss further.

Q: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first find the area of the original square piece of cloth.

Let the side length of the original square be x feet.

After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x feet. The area of this rectangle is (x-4) * x = x^2 - 4x square feet.

Since this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles of equal area, the area of each triangle is (x^2 - 4x) / 2 = 70 square feet.

Thus, x^2 - 4x = 140.

Rearranging the equation, we have x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0.

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation to find the side length of the original square cloth. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get (x-14)(x+10) = 0.

Therefore, x = 14 or x = -10. Since the side length of the cloth cannot be negative, x = 14 feet.

The perimeter of the original square cloth is 4 * x = 4 * 14 = 56 feet.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 56.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 56

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the square cloth has four equal sides and a square shape.
2. Trimming 4 feet on one edge results in a rectangle with two sides of equal length.
3. This rectangular piece is then cut diagonally to form two right triangles with the same area of 70 square feet each.
4. Since each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, the base and height of each triangle are not directly given.
5. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = 0.5 * base * height.
6. Since the area of each triangle is known to be 70 square feet, you can set up an equation using this information to find the base and height of each triangle.
7. Once you find the base and height of each triangle, you can then calculate the perimeter of the original square cloth by considering the lengths of the sides before the 4-foot trim was made.

By following these steps, you can determine the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth. Let me know if you need any further assistance in calculating the solution.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (C) 60 feet. 

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of one triangle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times base \times height = 70 \).
2. Since the two triangles are equal, the total area of both triangles is 140 square feet.
3. From the given information, we know that after trimming 4 feet from one side, the resulting rectangle is cut horizontally into two triangles.
4. Let x be the original side length of the square cloth.
5. The area of the original square cloth is \( x^2 \) square feet.
6. After trimming 4 feet from one side, the area of the resulting rectangle is \( (x-4) \times x \) square feet.
7. Since this area is then cut diagonally into two triangles with an area of 70 square feet each, we have the equation: \( \frac{1}{2} \times (x-4) \times x = 70 \).
8. Solving this equation gives us x = 14.
9. The perimeter of the original square cloth is 4 times the side length, so the perimeter is \( 4 \times 14 = 56 \) feet.
10. Therefore, the correct answer is 56 feet.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Given the original length of the ribbon is 30 cm
2. The ratio of reduction is 5:3
3. To find the new length of the ribbon after the reduction, we need to find the common factor to scale down the original length
4. The common factor between 5 and 3 is 3
5. The new length of the ribbon can be calculated by dividing the original length by the common factor (30/5 = 6), then multiplying by the other number in the ratio (6 * 3 = 18)
6. Therefore, the length of the ribbon now is 18 cm

Thus, the correct answer choice is (A) 18.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the new length of the ribbon after it was reduced in the ratio 5:3, we can set up the following proportion:

Original length / Reduced length = 5 / 3

Let's let x be the new length of the ribbon:

\(30 / x = 5 / 3\)

Now we can solve for x:

\(30 \times 3 = 5 \times x\)

\(90 = 5x\)

\(x = 90 / 5\)

\(x = 18\)

Therefore, the length of the ribbon now is 18 cm, so the correct answer is (A) 18.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 18

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the current length of the ribbon after it was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3 from its original length of 30 cm, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total parts in the ratio 5 : 3:
Total parts = 5 + 3 = 8

2. Determine the reduction factor by dividing the original length by the total parts:
Reduction factor = 30 cm / 8 = 3.75 cm per part

3. Multiply the reduction factor by the number of parts representing the reduced length (3 parts):
Reduced length = 3.75 cm/part * 3 parts = 11.25 cm

Therefore, the current length of the ribbon is 11.25 cm. Let's check the answer choices to see which one matches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 15 cm.

Q: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to better understand how to solve it:

1. Given:
  - M = abc is a three-digit number
  - N = cba
  - M > N
  - M - N + 396c = 990

2. We first need to understand the values of M and N.
  - Since M = abc is a three-digit number and N = cba, we have:
    - M = 100a + 10b + c
    - N = 100c + 10b + a
    
3. Since M > N, we also know that abc > cba, which implies that a > c or a = c and b > b.
   - This means the hundreds digit of M is greater than the hundreds digit of N.

4. Using the given equation M - N + 396c = 990, we can substitute the expressions for M and N to get:
   - (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
   - 99a - 99c + 396c = 990
   - 99(a - c) + 396c = 990
   - 99(a - c) = 990 - 396c
   - a - c = 10 - 4c

5. Now, since we want to find the values of M that are more than 300, we know that a must be at least 4 for M to be greater than 300.

6. From the equation a - c = 10 - 4c, we see that a = 10 - 4c + c = 10 - 3c.
   - So, for M to be greater than 300 (a ≥ 4), we must have 10 - 3c ≥ 4.
   - Solving this inequality, we get c ≤ 2.

7. Thus, values of c that satisfy c ≤ 2 are c = 0, 1, 2.
   - This means there are three possible values for c.

8. For each value of c, we can find the corresponding values of M.
   - When c = 0, a = 10, and M = 1000 + 10b
   - When c = 1, a = 7, 8, 9 and M = 700 + 10b, 800 + 10b, 900 + 10b
   - When c = 2, a = 4, 5, 6 and M = 400 + 10b, 500 + 10b, 600 + 10b

9. Thus, there are a total of 10 combinations that satisfy the conditions, with c = 1 and a = 7, 8, 9 providing the more than 300 values.

10. Therefore, the correct answer should be (A) 20 since there are 10 combinations that satisfy the conditions in the problem.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 20

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the solution, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. M = abc is a three-digit number, and N = cba.
2. Since M > N, this means M cannot have the same digits as N, and hence a ≠ c.
3. We are given that M - N + 396c = 990, so we can express M - N as (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99(a - c).
4. Substituting this into the equation, we get 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.
5. Simplifying, we have 99a - 99c + 396c = 990, which further simplifies to 99(a + 3c) = 990 or a + 3c = 10.
6. Since a and c are digits, the possible values for (a, c) pairs to satisfy a + 3c = 10 are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1).
7. Therefore, the only possible values for (a, c) that make M greater than 300 are (3, 1) and (2, 2), resulting in the numbers 312 and 322.

Therefore, the number of values of M greater than 300 is 2.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps to solve it accurately.

1. Let's consider M = abc and N = cba, where a, b, and c are digits.
2. We are given that M > N, which means abc > cba.
3. We can write abc - cba + 396c = 990.
4. Writing abc - cba as (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a), we get 99a - 99c + 396c = 990.
5. Simplifying further, we get 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.
6. Dividing by 3, we get 33(a - c) + 132c = 330.
7. Simplifying, we get 33(a - c) + 132c = 330.
8. Further simplifying gives us 33(a - c) = 198 - 4c.
9. Since a and c are integers between 0 and 9, we can calculate the possible values of a - c and c that satisfy the equation.
10. Finally, we need to count how many values of M are more than 300 and fit the conditions given in the problem.

By following these steps and carefully considering the conditions, we can find the correct answer to the question. Let me know if you need help solving any specific part of the problem.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Finding the correct answer involves carefully solving the last portion of the problem where we determine the values of M that are greater than 300. By applying the steps outlined above, we can solve for a and c and identify the values of M that meet the conditions given.

Upon solving the equation 33(a - c) = 198 - 4c, we need to consider the possible digit values for a and c that satisfy the equation. Once we determine these values, we can then count the number of M values that are greater than 300 and meet the given conditions.

Therefore, based on the calculations and steps, the correct answer to the question regarding the number of M values greater than 300 would be one of the provided answer choices. Let's proceed with the calculations to determine the exact value.

Q: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to consider the minimum number of students that could have taken both Physics and Math to satisfy the given percentages. 

Let the total number of students be x. 
Given that 20% of them took Physics, we have 0.20x students taking Physics. 
Given that 28% of them took Math, we have 0.28x students taking Math. 

We can calculate the minimum number of students taking both Physics and Math by finding the maximum possible overlap between the two subjects. For this, we find the least number of students by considering the highest common factor of 20% and 28%, which is 4%. 

Since 4% of the students should have taken both Physics and Math, we can calculate 0.04x. 

To find the least possible number of students, we will consider the formula: 
Number of students = Number of Physics students + Number of Math students - Number of students taking both Physics and Math. 
This gives us x = 0.20x + 0.28x - 0.04x. 

Solving the equation, we get:
x = 0.20x + 0.28x - 0.04x
x = 0.44x
x / 0.44 = x
x = 501 students. 

Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school must be at least 501. Since this is not among the answer choices provided, the correct option would be (E) none of these.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we can start by finding the total number of students who took either physics or math. 

Let P be the number of students who took physics, and M be the number of students who took math. The number of students who took either physics or math is given by P + M.

Given that 20% (0.2) took physics and 28% (0.28) took math, we can write the following equations:

P = 0.2 * N
M = 0.28 * N

where N is the total number of students in the school.

Therefore, the number of students who took either physics or math is P + M:

P + M = 0.2 * N + 0.28 * N = 0.48 * N

Given that this total number of students who took either physics or math is more than 501, we have:

0.48 * N > 501

To find the least possible number of students, we can set up the inequality:

0.48 * N > 501
N > 501 / 0.48
N > 1043.75

Since the number of students must be a whole number, the smallest possible value for N that satisfies the inequality is 1044. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 1044, which is not one of the answer choices provided.

Thus, the answer would be: (E) None of these.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) none of these.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to consider the scenario where the percentage of students taking physics and math is maximized while still having more than 501 students in total.

Let's denote the number of students in the school as "n". Given that 20% took physics and 28% took math, we can set up the following inequalities:

0.20n > 501 (at least 20% took physics)
0.28n > 501 (at least 28% took math)

To find the minimum value of n, we can combine these inequalities and solve for n:

0.28n > 501
Divide by 0.28 on both sides:
n > 501 / 0.28
n > 1789.29

Since the number of students must be a whole number, the least possible number of students in the school would be 1790.

Therefore, the correct choice is (E) none of these, as none of the provided answer choices match the minimum possible number of students in the school.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) none of these

Q: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now? Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 41 (C) 40 (D) 42 (E) 43
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let R represent Rahim's current age and r represent Raj's age 5 years back.

According to the information given:
1. Raj is 17 years old now.
2. Raj's age 5 years back = 17 - 5 = 12

Given that Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, we can set up the equation:
r = (1/3) * R

Substitute the values:
12 = (1/3) * R

Now, solve for R:
R = 12 * 3
R = 36

Therefore, Rahim is currently 36 years old. 

However, the options provided do not include 36. Considering the closest option, Rahim would be 37 years old (Option A) based on rounding up from 36.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 37

Q: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now? Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 41 (C) 40 (D) 42 (E) 43
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to determine Raj's age 5 years ago.

Raj is currently 17 years old, so 5 years ago he would have been (17-5) = 12 years old.

Given that 5 years ago Raj was one-third as old as Rahim, we can set up the following equation:

(1/3) * Rahim's age 5 years ago = Raj's age 5 years ago
(1/3) * (Rahim - 5) = 12

Multiply both sides by 3:
Rahim - 5 = 36

Adding 5 to both sides gives:
Rahim = 41

Therefore, Rahim is 41 years old now.

So, the answer choice is (B) 41.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 41

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's determine Raj's age 5 years ago. Since Raj is 17 now, 5 years ago he would have been 17 - 5 = 12 years old.

It's given that 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So, if Raj was 12 years old 5 years ago, Rahim would have been 3 times that age, which is 12 x 3 = 36 years old.

Now, to find out Rahim's current age, we need to add 5 years to Rahim's age 5 years ago, which is 36 + 5 = 41 years old.

Therefore, Rahim is 41 years old now. So, the correct answer choice is (B) 41.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 41

Q: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the area of the field the cow can graze while tethered. Since the rope is 14 feet long, the area the cow can graze forms a circle with a radius of 14 feet.

The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.

In this case, the radius (r) is 14 feet. Therefore, the area the cow can graze is:
A = π(14)^2
A = π(196)
A = 196π

Given that the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, we can calculate how many days it will take for the cow to graze the whole field:
Total area of the field = 196π sq.ft.
Area grazed per day = 10 sq.ft.
Number of days to graze the whole field = Total area of the field / Area grazed per day
Number of days = 196π / 10
Number of days ≈ 62.03

Rounded up to the nearest whole number, it will take approximately 63 days for the cow to graze the entire field. Therefore, the answer choice closest to this calculated time is (B) 61 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 61 days

Q: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the area of the field that the cow can graze while tethered. 

The area that can be grazed by the cow is a circle, with the radius equal to the length of the rope (14 feet). The formula to calculate the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle.

Thus, the area of the circle that the cow can graze is A = π(14 feet)^2 = π(196 feet^2) ≈ 615.75 square feet.

Given that the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, we can determine the number of days it will take for the cow to graze the entire field by dividing the total area of the field by the daily grazing area:

Time = Total Area / Daily Grazing Area
Time = 615.75 sq.ft / 10 sq.ft per day
Time ≈ 61.575 days

Since the cow cannot graze a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the cow will take approximately 62 days to graze the whole field.

Therefore, the closest answer choice to our approximation is (B) 61 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 61 days

Q: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total area of the field that the cow can graze within the reach of a 14-foot rope. Since the rope forms a circle centered at the cow's tethering point, the area the cow can graze is a circular region.

The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is 14 feet.

So, the total area the cow can graze within the reach of the 14-foot rope is:
A = π(14)^2
A = π(196)
A ≈ 615.75 sq.ft.

Now we know that the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, so to find out how many days it will take for the cow to graze the entire field, we need to divide the total area of the field by the grazing area per day:
Days = Total area / Grazing area per day
Days = 615.75 sq.ft. / 10 sq.ft.
Days ≈ 61.575 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the cow will take approximately 62 days to graze the whole field.

Therefore, the correct answer choice would be (B) 61 days as it is the closest option to the calculated result of 62 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 61 days

Q: A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ? Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, let's find the cost price (CP) of the book when sold at Rs. 27.50 with a 10% profit:
Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 27.50
Profit Percentage = 10%
Let CP be x.
Therefore, SP = CP + Profit
27.50 = x + 0.10x
27.50 = 1.10x
x = 27.50 / 1.10
x = 25

So, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.

2. Now, let's calculate the profit and loss when the book is sold for Rs. 25.75:
Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 25.75
Cost Price (CP) = Rs. 25
Let's find the profit/loss amount:
Profit/Loss = SP - CP
Profit/Loss = 25.75 - 25
Profit/Loss = 0.75

Now, let's find the percentage of profit/loss:
Profit Percentage = (Profit / CP) * 100
Profit Percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100
Profit Percentage = 3%

Hence, the percentage of profit when the book is sold for Rs. 25.75 is 3%, which means the correct answer choice is (B) 3% Profit.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 3% Profit

Q: A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ? Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Calculation of Cost Price (CP) and Selling Price (SP) of the book:
Given that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, we can calculate the cost price (CP) and selling price (SP) as follows:
SP = CP + Profit
SP = 1.10 * CP (since profit is 10% of CP)
27.50 = 1.10 * CP
CP = 27.50 / 1.10
CP = Rs 25

Step 2: Calculating profit percentage for selling price of Rs 27.50:
Profit = SP - CP
Profit = 27.50 - 25
Profit = Rs 2.50
Profit percentage = (Profit / CP) * 100
Profit percentage = (2.50 / 25) * 100
Profit percentage = 10%

Step 3: Find the new selling price (SP) for Rs 25.75:
Given that the book is sold for Rs 25.75, we can determine if there is a profit or loss by calculating the difference between the cost price (CP) and this new selling price (SP).

Step 4: Calculation for the new selling price of Rs 25.75:
Profit/Loss = SP - CP
Profit/Loss = 25.75 - 25
Profit/Loss = Rs 0.75

Step 5: Calculating profit or loss percentage for selling price of Rs 25.75:
Profit/Loss percentage = (Profit/Loss / CP) * 100
Profit/Loss percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100
Profit/Loss percentage = 3%

Therefore, the answer is (B) 3% Profit for selling the book at Rs 25.75.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 3% Profit

Q: A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ? Answer Choices: (A) 2% Profit (B) 3% Profit (C) 2% Loss (D) 3% Loss (E) 4% Loss
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of cost price, selling price, and profit/loss percentage. 

Given:
Selling price of the book = Rs. 27.50
Profit percentage = 10%
Cost price of the book = ? (Let's denote it as CP)

To find the cost price, we use the formula:
Selling price = Cost price + Profit
27.50 = CP + 0.1 * CP
27.50 = CP + 0.1CP
27.50 = 1.1CP
CP = 27.50 / 1.1
CP = Rs. 25

Now we need to find the profit/loss percentage when the book is sold for Rs. 25.75.

Profit/Loss = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = 25.75 - 25 = Rs. 0.75

To find the profit/loss percentage, we use the formula:
Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100
Profit percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100
Profit percentage = 3%

Therefore, when the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, the percentage of profit would be 3%. So the correct answer is (B) 3% Profit.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 3% Profit

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can first seat Susan on the leftmost chair. Then, Tim can be seated in the middle chair and Zen can be seated on the remaining chair. 

Since the seating arrangement of the children is fixed as Susan-Tim-Zen, there is only 1 way to arrange them on the 3 identical chairs.

There are 3 children, so there are 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to arrange them on the chairs.

Now, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the children such that Susan is always on the left of Tim.

Since Susan must be on the left of Tim, the possible arrangements are:

Q: The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let:
- x be the part of the bill that is fixed (independent of the number of calls),
- y be the part of the bill that varies with the number of calls, and
- c be the cost per call.

From the given information:
1. For 540 calls:
x + 540c = 1800
2. For 620 calls:
x + 620c = 2040

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and c. Once we have these values, we can determine the bill for 500 calls using the equation x + 500c.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To find the bill for 500 units consumed due to more holidays, let's start by solving the system of equations we set up based on the given information for 540 calls and 620 calls:

1. For 540 calls:
x + 540c = 1800

2. For 620 calls:
x + 620c = 2040

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and c:

1. Subtract the first equation from the second one:
620c - 540c = 2040 - 1800
80c = 240
c = 240 / 80
c = 3

2. Substitute c = 3 into the first equation and solve for x:
x + 540(3) = 1800
x + 1620 = 1800
x = 1800 - 1620
x = 180

Now that we have the values of x and c, we can determine the bill for 500 units consumed:
x + 500c = 180 + 500(3) = 180 + 1500 = Rs.1680

Therefore, the bill for that month with 500 units consumed would be Rs.1680, which corresponds to option B.

Q: The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the fixed cost and the cost per call. 

Let the fixed cost be represented by F and the cost per call be represented by C.

From the given information: 
- When 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs. 1800. This can be represented as 540C + F = 1800.  
- When 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs. 2040. This can be represented as 620C + F = 2040.

We can set up a system of two equations to solve for C and F.  
To solve these equations, we can use the elimination method or substitution method.

Once we find the values of C and F, we can calculate the bill for 500 calls by substituting the values into the equation 500C + F.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's start by solving the system of equations:

1) 540C + F = 1800
2) 620C + F = 2040

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we can eliminate F:

620C + F - (540C + F) = 2040 - 1800
80C = 240
C = 240 / 80
C = 3

Now, we can substitute the value of C back into equation 1 to find F:

540(3) + F = 1800
1620 + F = 1800
F = 1800 - 1620
F = 180

So, the fixed cost (F) is Rs. 180 and the cost per call (C) is Rs. 3.

Now, we can calculate the bill for 500 calls:

500(3) + 180 = 1500 + 180 = Rs. 1680

Therefore, the bill for 500 calls in the month with more holidays would be Rs. 1680. 

Among the answer choices provided, the correct option is (B) Rs. 1680.

holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Understand the given information
- The telephone bill is partly fixed and partly varies based on the number of calls consumed.
- In the first month, 540 calls result in a bill of Rs.1800.
- In the second month, 620 calls result in a bill of Rs.2040.

Step 2: Identify the fixed and variable components
- Let 'F' be the fixed component of the bill and 'V' be the variable component based on the number of calls.
- From the information given, we have:
1800 = F + 540V (for the first month)
2040 = F + 620V (for the second month)

Step 3: Solve the two equations
- First, we need to determine the values of 'F' and 'V' by solving the above simultaneous equations.
- Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate 'F':
2040 - 1800 = F + 620V - F - 540V
240 = 80V
V = 3

Step 4: Find the fixed component 'F'
- Substitute the value of 'V' back into the first equation:
1800 = F + 540(3)
1800 = F + 1620
F = 180

Step 5: Determine the bill for 500 calls (the third month)
- For 500 calls, the bill will be:
Bill = F + 500V
Bill = 180 + 500(3)
Bill = 180 + 1500
Bill = Rs.1680

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls consumed would be Rs.1680, which corresponds to answer choice (B).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) Rs.1680

If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of rotations made by each ball in a certain amount of time. This will tell us when the two balls will be at the same starting point again.

Ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, so it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes.
Ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, so it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.

The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes, which means that both balls will complete an equal number of rotations and meet again at the starting point after 91 minutes.

Converting 91 minutes to hours and minutes:
91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Q: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the time at which balls A and B will be at the same starting point again, we first need to determine the time it takes for each ball to make one full revolution.

Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for ball A to make one full rotation.

Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for ball B to make one full rotation.

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the times taken for one full rotation by each ball. The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes.

Therefore, balls A and B will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes, which is equivalent to 1 hour and 31 minutes.

So, the correct answer choice is (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes

Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find out when both balls will be at the same starting point again, we need to determine the time it takes for both balls to complete a whole number of rotations.

Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes for one full rotation of Ball A.

Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes for one full rotation of Ball B.

To find the least common multiple (LCM) of the times for one full rotation for each ball, we can use the prime factorization method.

13 = 13
7 = 7

LCM(13, 7) = 13 x 7 = 91

Therefore, both balls will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes.

Converting 91 minutes to hours and minutes:
91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

So, the correct answer choice is (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes

Q: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of newspapers ordered on any day other than Sunday as x.
2. Given that the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, the number of newspapers ordered on Sunday is 2x.
3. The cost of each newspaper on Sunday is $4, and the cost on other days is $1. So, for the entire week:
   - Number of newspapers: 2x on Sunday + x on other days = 3x total
   - Total cost of newspapers: $4 * 2x (Sunday) + $1 * x (other days) = $8x + $x = $9x
4. As per the given information, the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers:
   - $9x = $210
   - x = $210 / $9
   - x = 23.33 (approx.)
5. Since the hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, they must be buying 23 newspapers on each of the other days apart from Sunday.
6. The number of newspapers ordered on Monday is x = 23.
   
Therefore, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on Monday. 
So, the correct answer is (A) 15.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 15

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Define the variables:
Let x be the number of newspapers ordered on a regular day (Monday to Saturday).
Then, the number of newspapers ordered on Sunday would be 2x.

Step 2: Write the equation based on the information given:
Cost equation: $4(2x) + $1(x) = $210
Simplify: 8x + x = $210
Combine like terms: 9x = $210
Solve for x: x = $210 / 9
x = 23.33 (approx.)

Step 3: Since the hotel cannot purchase a fraction of a newspaper, we need to find the closest whole number. 
The closest whole number to the average number of newspapers on a regular day would be either 23 or 24.

Thus, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on Monday.

Therefore, the correct answer is not given in the answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not present. Would you like me to recheck the calculations or help you with anything else?

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Let's denote the number of newspapers ordered on the rest of the days of the week as x. 

Step 2: Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, the number of newspapers ordered on Sunday would be 2x.

Step 3: The total cost of the newspapers for the week would be $4 (for Sunday) * 1 day + $1 (for the rest of the days) * 6 days = $10.

Step 4: We know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, so we can set up the equation 4(2x) + 1(x) = 210 to find the value of x.

Step 5: Solve the equation: 8x + x = 210. This simplifies to 9x = 210. Dividing both sides by 9, x = 23.33. Since the hotel can only order whole numbers of newspapers, we should round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 6: Since the rounded value of x is 23, the hotel orders 23 newspapers on the rest of the days of the week.

Step 7: The hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday, so they order 2*23 = 46 newspapers on Sunday.

Step 8: We need to find out how many newspapers the hotel buys on Monday, which refers to the newspapers on the rest of the days of the week. Therefore, the answer is 23 newspapers.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A) 15.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 15

Q: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 16 (D) 24 (E) 25
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first set up an equation using the given information.

Let x be the total number of friends who originally planned to go on the picnic, and let y be the number of friends who actually attended the picnic.

From the information given:
1. Total amount planned to be spent = Rs. 96
2. Amount contributed by each person when 4 friends did not turn up = Rs. 4 extra
3. Total amount contributed by y friends = Rs. 96

So, our equation will be:
(96 - 4*(x-y))/y = 4

Now, we need to simplify and solve this equation to find the value of y (the number of friends who attended the picnic).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's simplify and solve the equation we set up to find the value of y:

(96 - 4*(x-y)) / y = 4
(96 - 4x + 4y) / y = 4
96 - 4x + 4y = 4y
96 - 4x = 4y - 4y
96 - 4x = 0
4x = 96
x = 24

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 24.

Among the answer choices provided, the correct answer is (D) 24.

Q: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of friends who actually attended the picnic be "x".

2. The total cost of eatables that they initially planned to spend is Rs. 96.

3. Since 4 friends did not turn up, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.

4. The new total cost of eatables after the 4 friends did not turn up is Rs. 96 + (4*x) = Rs. (96 + 4x).

5. We can set up an equation to find the value of "x" by considering the total cost before and after the 4 friends did not turn up:

   Total cost before = Total cost after

   96 = 96 + 4x

   4x = 0

   x = 0

6. Since it doesn't make sense for "x" to be 0, there seems to be an issue with the initial problem statement or setup. It's possible that there might be a mistake in the way the problem is presented.

It's important to carefully analyze the information provided in a math problem to ensure that it is logically sound and mathematically accurate.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is There seems to be an inconsistency or error in the information provided in the problem. The calculations lead to x = 0, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. As a result, we cannot determine the correct number of attendees based on the given information.

I recommend reviewing the problem statement to ensure accuracy and coherence in the details provided. Feel free to provide any additional information or clarify any uncertainties so we can help you further with the correct solution.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step to solve it:

1. Let's denote the original number of friends who were supposed to go on the picnic as 'x', and the amount each of them was supposed to contribute as 'y'.
2. According to the given information, the total amount they were supposed to spend on eatables was Rs. 96, so we have the equation: x*y = 96. This is our first equation.
3. Four friends did not turn up, so the remaining number of friends who attended the picnic is (x-4).
4. Now, due to the absence of the 4 friends, each of the remaining members had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. So, the new contribution amount per person is (y+4).
5. The new total amount spent on eatables by the remaining friends is (x-4)*(y+4).
6. According to the given condition, this new total amount is equal to the original total amount: (x-4)*(y+4) = 96.
7. Now, we have two equations:
    i. x*y = 96
    ii. (x-4)*(y+4) = 96
8. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of 'x', which represents the number of friends who attended the picnic.
9. Once we find the value of 'x', we can determine the correct answer choice from the given options.

Let's proceed with solving the equations to find the number of friends who attended the picnic.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's continue solving the equations:

From equation i: x*y = 96
From equation ii:    (x-4)*(y+4) = 96

Expanding equation ii:
x*y + 4x - 4y - 16 = 96
Substitute x*y = 96 from equation i:
96 + 4x - 4y - 16 = 96
4x - 4y = 16

Divide the equation by 4:
x - y = 4

Substitute x*y = 96 from equation i:
x - 96/x = 4
x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0
(x - 12)(x + 8) = 0

x = 12 or x = -8

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, the correct answer is x = 12. Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic was 12.

Among the answer choices A, B, C, D, and E, the correct answer is (B) 12.

Q: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To approach this problem, we need to first determine the perimeter of the rectangle before it is reshaped into a square. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + breadth).

Given that the length of the original rectangle is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm, the perimeter of the original rectangle would be:
P = 2(27 + 17) = 2(44) = 88 cm.

Since the wire from the rectangle is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the original rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a square is P = 4s, where s is the length of one side of the square.

Therefore, we have:
88 = 4s
Solving for s:
s = 88 / 4
s = 22

Therefore, the measure of each side of the square formed by bending the wire is 22 cm. So, the correct answer choice is (C) 22.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 22

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we start by calculating the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula: 

Perimeter of rectangle = 2*(length + breadth)

Given:
Length = 27 cm
Breadth = 17 cm

Perimeter of rectangle = 2*(27 + 17) = 2*(44) = 88 cm

Since the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will also be equal to 88 cm. 

In a square, all sides are equal in length. Therefore, the formula for the perimeter of a square can also be expressed as:

Perimeter of square = 4*side

Given:
Perimeter of square = 88 cm

So, 88 cm = 4*side
Divide both sides by 4 to find the length of each side:
side = 88 cm / 4 = 22 cm

Therefore, the measure of each side of the square formed will be 22 cm.

The correct answer choice is (C) 22.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 22

Q: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 11 (C) 22 (D) 25 (E) 31
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the required answer, you first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: P = 2(l + b), where l is the length and b is the breadth. 

Given the length (l) is 27 cm and the breadth (b) is 17 cm, the perimeter of the rectangle is:
P = 2(27 + 17) = 2(44) = 88 cm.

Since the rebent wire now forms a square, the total length of the wire will be the perimeter of the square. Therefore, we need to find the side of the square.

In a square, all sides are equal. Let s be the side length of the square.

For a square, the formula to calculate the perimeter is P = 4s, where s is the side length.

Since the perimeter of the square is 88 cm, we have:
P = 4s
88 = 4s
Divide both sides by 4:
s = 88 / 4
s = 22

Therefore, the measure of each side of the square formed after bending the wire is 22 cm.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C) 22.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 22

Q: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ? Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as x.

- Each daughter receives 4 times as much as each nephew. So, each daughter receives 4x.
- Each son receives 5 times as much as each nephew. So, each son receives 5x.

Now, we can express the total amount distributed in terms of x:

4 daughters x 4x + 5 sons x 5x + 2 nephews x x = 8600

Solving this equation, we get:

16x + 25x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4 * 200 = Rs 800.

So, the correct answer is (E) Rs 800.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) Rs 800

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Let the amount each nephew receives be x.

Step 2: Each daughter receives 4 times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.

Step 3: Each son receives 5 times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.

Step 4: Let's calculate the total amount given to 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews.

Total amount = 5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2x
Total amount = 25x + 16x + 2x
Total amount = 43x

Step 5: Given that the total amount is Rs 8600, we can set up the equation:

43x = 8600

Step 6: Solve for x:
x = 8600 / 43
x = 200

Step 7: Each daughter receives 4x, so each daughter receives:
4 * 200 = 800

Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800. 

Therefore, the answer is (E) Rs 800.

Q: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ? Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, let's denote:
Let the amount each nephew receives be x.
Each daughter would receive 4x, and each son would receive 5x.

Now, the total amount divided among all 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews is Rs 8600.
So, we can write the equation:
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 8600 / 43
x = 200

Each daughter receives 4 times as much as each nephew, which is 4 * 200 = Rs 800.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Rs 800.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) Rs 800

Q: In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 80 (C) 95 (D) 100 (E) 85
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4.
2. This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets.
3. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, we need to determine how many red sweets there are.
4. Since the ratio of red to green is 3:4, we can set up a proportion to solve for the number of red sweets.
5. The proportion would be: 3/4 = x/120, where "x" is the number of red sweets.
6. Cross multiply to solve for x: 3 * 120 = 4 * x.
7. Simplify: 360 = 4x.
8. Divide both sides by 4 to isolate x: x = 360 / 4 = 90.
9. Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to use the ratio provided to determine the total number of red sweets.  

Given that the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, we can represent this as:  
3x : 4x  

Since the bag contains 120 green sweets, we have the quantity of green sweets as 4x = 120.  
Solving for x gives x = 120 / 4 = 30.  

Now, to find the number of red sweets, we substitute x back into the ratio for red sweets:  
3 * 30 = 90  

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.  
The correct answer choice is (A) 90.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 90

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of sweets in the bag. Since the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, there are a total of 3+4=7 parts.

Next, we need to find out how many red sweets there are. Since the ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4, the red sweets make up 3 out of 7 parts. Therefore, the proportion of red sweets to the total number of sweets is 3/7.

Given that there are 120 green sweets, we can now calculate the total number of sweets in the bag. Since the green sweets make up 4 parts out of 7, we can set up the equation:

120 / 4 = X / 7,

where X is the total number of sweets in the bag.

Solving for X, we get:

X = (120 * 7) / 4 = 210.

Therefore, the bag contains a total of 210 sweets.

Now that we know the total number of sweets in the bag, we can calculate the number of red sweets. Since the red sweets make up 3 parts out of 7, we can calculate the number of red sweets as:

(3/7) * 210 = 90.

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag. 

So, the correct answer is (A) 90.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 90

Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can first find the common ratio of the arithmetic progression (A.P.) by using the given information that the common difference is 3 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, 3 months is equivalent to 1/4 year.

Let the number of members in the club be 'n', and the ages of the members form an arithmetic progression. The total age of all the members can be expressed as the sum of an arithmetic progression:

Total age = (n/2) * [2A + (n-1)d]

Where:
n = number of members
A = age of the youngest member
d = common difference (in years)

Given:
A = 7 years
Total age = 250
d = 1/4 years

Substitute these values into the formula and solve for 'n':

250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*(1/4)]
250 = (n/2) * [14 + (n-1)/4]
250 = (n/2) * [14 + n/4 - 1/4]
250 = (n/2) * [n/4 + 55/4]

Solving this equation will give us the value of 'n', which represents the number of members in the club.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 26

Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to approach it systematically by breaking it down into steps:

Step 1: Understand the information given in the problem:
- The youngest member of the club is 7 years old.
- The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (AP) with a common difference of 3 months.
- The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.

Step 2: Find the total number of months of all the members' ages:
- Since the common difference is 3 months, we can consider the ages in months.
- Let's denote the number of members in the club as 'n'.
- The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula: Sum = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d], where 'a' is the first term and 'd' is the common difference.
- In our case, 'a' is 7 years = 84 months (since 1 year = 12 months) and 'd' is 3 months.

Step 3: Calculate the number of members (n) in the club:
- Using the formula for the sum of an AP: 250 = (n/2) * [2*84 + (n-1)*3].
- Simplify this equation to find the value of 'n'.

Step 4: Determine the correct answer choice based on the calculated value of 'n':
- Once you calculate the value of 'n', compare it to the answer choices provided in the question and select the option that matches.

By following these steps, we can systematically solve the problem to determine the number of members in the club. Let me know if you need any further clarification on the calculations or steps involved.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (C) 25 members in the club.

Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the age of the oldest member in the club. 

Let the number of members in the club be 'n', and the youngest member's age be 7 years. Since the ages are in an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months, the oldest member's age can be expressed as: 7 + (n-1)*3 = 7 + 3n - 3 = 4 + 3n years.

The sum of the ages of all members is 250. Therefore, the sum can be calculated as the average of the youngest and oldest member's ages, multiplied by the number of members:

(7 + 4 + 3n) * n / 2 = 250
(11 + 3n) * n / 2 = 250
11n + 3n^2 = 500
3n^2 + 11n - 500 = 0

Now, we can solve this quadratic equation to find the number of members 'n'. The factors of -150 which add up to +11 are 25 and -6. Therefore, n = 25 or n = -6. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 25.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 25 members in the club.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 25

Q: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit? Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Karan's cost price of the sewing machine = Rs. 1200
2. Karan wants to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.
3. So, let's first calculate the selling price after offering a 20% discount.
   Selling price after 20% discount = Cost price - 20% of cost price
   Selling price = Rs. 1200 - (20/100) * Rs. 1200
                  = Rs. 1200 - Rs. 240
                  = Rs. 960
4. Now, Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the selling price of Rs. 960.
   Let the selling price be SP
   Cost price = Rs. 1200
   Profit percentage = 20%
   Profit = 20% of SP
   Again, let's use the profit formula:
   SP = CP + Profit
   SP = CP + (20/100) * SP
   SP = 1200 + (20/100) * SP
   SP = 1200 + 0.20 * SP
   0.80 * SP = 1200
   SP = 1200 / 0.80
   SP = Rs. 1500
5. Therefore, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount is Rs. 1500.

Based on the options provided, the closest match to Rs. 1500 is (C) 1,876.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 1,876

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cost price of the sewing machine for Karan = Rs. 1200

2. Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price. This means he aims to sell the sewing machine for 120% of its cost price.

3. Selling price (SP) for a 20% profit = Cost price (CP) + Profit
   SP = CP + 0.20 * CP
   SP = 1.20 * CP

4. Karan is also offering a 20% discount on the selling price. So, the final selling price will be 80% of the selling price calculated above.

5. Final selling price (SP) after 20% discount = 0.80 * SP
   SP after discount = 0.80 * 1.20 * CP
   SP after discount = 0.96 * CP

6. Now, in order to find out at what price Karan should mark the sewing machine, we need to have the selling price after the 20% discount equal to the marked price.

7. Let MP be the marked price, then: MP = 0.96 * CP
   MP = 0.96 * 1200
   MP = Rs. 1,152

Therefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1,152 to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is not among the options provided, so let's correctly calculate the marked price that Karan should set:

Given:
Cost price of the sewing machine = Rs. 1200
Karan wants to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.

1. Let's first calculate the selling price (SP) where Karan aims to make a 20% profit:
   SP = Cost price + Profit
   SP = Rs. 1200 + 20% of CP
   SP = Rs. 1200 + (20/100) * 1200
   SP = Rs. 1200 + 240
   SP = Rs. 1440

2. Next, let's calculate the marked price (MP) after offering a 20% discount:
   MP = SP / (1 - Discount %)
   MP = Rs. 1440 / (1 - 0.20)
   MP = Rs. 1440 / 0.80
   MP = Rs. 1800

Therefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800 so that after offering a 20% discount, he makes a 20% profit.

Among the provided options, the correct answer is (E) 1,800.

Q: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit? Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Calculate the selling price after a 20% discount
Original cost of the sewing machine = Rs. 1200/-
Karan wants to make a 20% profit. Therefore, the selling price should be 1200 + 20% of 1200 = 1200 + 0.2*1200 = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440/-

Let's calculate the price after a 20% discount:
Selling price after a 20% discount = 1440 - 20% of 1440 = 1440 - 0.2*1440 = 1440 - 288 = Rs. 1152/-

Step 2: Calculate the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine to sell it at Rs. 1152/- and make a 20% profit
Let x be the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine.

Since Karan wants to make a 20% profit:
Cost price = x
Selling price = 1.2*x (20% profit added)

But we already found out that the selling price should be Rs. 1152/-. So, 1.2*x = 1152

Dividing both sides by 1.2 to find the cost price:
x = 1152 / 1.2 = Rs. 960/-

Therefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 960/- in order to sell it at Rs. 1152/- after a 20% discount and still make a 20% profit.

Correct Answer: (E) 1,800.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 1,800

Q: Train ‘A’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the time when the two trains meet each other, we can use the concept of relative speed. The relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction is the difference between their speeds, and the relative speed of two objects moving in opposite directions is the sum of their speeds.

In this case, Train A has a head start of 3 hours (from 11 am to 2 pm), which means it travels for 3 hours before Train B starts. To find the distance covered by Train A before Train B starts, we use the formula: distance = speed * time.

For Train A:
Distance covered = 40 kmph * 3 hours = 120 km.

Now, when Train B starts, the distance between the two trains is 120 km. Since Train A is also moving towards Lucknow, we need to calculate the relative speed of Train A and Train B to determine at what time they will meet. The relative speed when moving in the same direction is the difference between their speeds:

Relative speed = 72 kmph - 40 kmph = 32 kmph.

To find the time when they will meet, we divide the initial distance between them (120 km) by the relative speed (32 kmph):

Time taken to meet = 120 km / 32 kmph = 3.75 hours.

Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3.75 hours from the time Train B starts at 2 pm. Adding this time to 2 pm, we get the meeting time as 5:45 pm. However, since the answer choices provided are in common time format, the closest option to 5:45 pm is 5 pm on the next day.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5 pm on the next day.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 5 pm on the next day.

Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find out when the two trains will meet each other, we can use the concept of relative speed. When two objects are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. 

In this case, Train A is traveling at 40 kmph and Train B is traveling at 72 kmph. Therefore, their relative speed when moving towards each other is 40 kmph + 72 kmph = 112 kmph.

The time it takes for the trains to meet is dependent on the distance between them. Since Train B leaves 3 hours after Train A, the distance covered by Train A in those 3 hours will need to be covered by both trains when they meet.

The distance covered by Train A in 3 hours = 40 kmph * 3 hours = 120 km

Now both trains combined are covering 112 kmph, so the time it will take to cover 120 km at this combined speed is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 120 km / 112 kmph ≈ 1.07 hours

Since Train A started at 11 am and Train B started at 2 pm (3 hours later), the time they meet will be 11 am + 1.07 hours ≈ 12.07 pm. 

Therefore, the two trains will meet each other around 12:07 pm. 
So, the correct answer is not provided in the options.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of these

Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed and distance traveled to determine when the two trains will meet.

Let the time when the two trains meet be T hours after Train A departs from Mumbai Central at 11 am. Since Train B departs 3 hours later (at 2 pm), it will be T - 3 hours after Train B departs.

Distance traveled by Train A = 40 km/hr * T hours
Distance traveled by Train B = 72 km/hr * (T - 3) hours

When the two trains meet, the sum of the distances covered by both trains will equal the total distance between them, which is the same for both trains since they are traveling on the same route. Therefore:

40T + 72(T - 3) = Distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow

Now, we can calculate the time T when the two trains meet.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To find the time when the two trains meet, we can use the equation:

40T + 72(T - 3) = Distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow

Solving this equation will give us the value of T, which represents the time in hours after Train A departs from Mumbai Central at 11 am when the two trains meet.

Let's calculate the time T using the given information:

40T + 72(T - 3) = Distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow
40T + 72T - 216 = Distance (since the total distance is constant for both trains)

Combining like terms:
112T - 216 = Distance

To find the exact time when the trains meet, we need to know the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. Without this information, we can't determine the exact time when the two trains will meet.

Q: Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 60 (C) 28 (D) 26 (E) 18
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

Let's assume Mark has M rupees and John has J rupees.

From the first statement: If John gives half of his money to Mark, Mark will have M + J/2 = 75.

From the second statement: If Mark gives one third of his money to John, John will have J + M/3 = 75.

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. M + J/2 = 75
2. J + M/3 = 75

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the value of J, which represents the amount of money John has.

Let's proceed step by step to solve this problem methodically.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To solve the system of equations:

1. M + J/2 = 75
2. J + M/3 = 75

Multiply the first equation by 3 to eliminate fractions:
3M + 3J/2 = 225

Multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate fractions:
2J + 2M/3 = 150

Now, subtract the second equation from the first:
(3M - 2M) + (3J/2 - 2J) = 225 - 150
M + J/2 = 75

This simplifies to:
M + J = 75 x 2 = 150

Substitute M + J = 150 back into the first equation:
150 = 75
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not present as both sides of the equation are not equal.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's assign variables to represent the amounts of money both Mark and John have.

Let's say Mark has M amount of money and John has J amount of money.

According to the first statement:
1. Mark tells John, "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75."

This can be represented as:
M + J/2 = 75

According to the second statement:
2. John says, "If you give me one-third of your money, I will have Rs.75."

This can be represented as:
J + M/3 = 75

Now, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of J (the amount of money John has).

Let's solve the system of equations:
1. M + J/2 = 75
2. J + M/3 = 75

Let's start by solving for M in terms of J using the first equation:
M = 75 - J/2

Now substitute M in the second equation:
J + (75 - J/2)/3 = 75

Solve for J:
J + 25 - J/6 = 75
Multiplying by 6 to get rid of the fraction:
6J + 150 - J = 450
Combining like terms:
5J = 300
J = 60

Therefore, John has Rs.60. 

So, the answer is (B) 60.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 60

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's define the following variables:
- Let the amount of money Mark has be M.
- Let the amount of money John has be J.

According to the first statement:
If John gives Mark half of his money, Mark will have Rs.75.
So, M + J/2 = 75

According to the second statement:
If Mark gives John one third of his money, John will have Rs.75.
So, M/3 + J = 75

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of J (the amount of money John has).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To solve the system of equations  M + J/2 = 75 and M/3 + J = 75, we can use substitution method or elimination method. Let's use substitution method in this case:

From the first equation M = 75 - J/2

Substitute this into the second equation:

(75 - J/2)/3 + J = 75
25 - J/6 + J = 75
25 - J/6 + 6J/6 = 75
25 + 5J/6 = 75
5J/6 = 50
5J = 300
J = 60

Therefore, John had Rs.60. The correct answer is (B) 60.

Q: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand the growth pattern of the water lilies on the lake. Given that the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can set up an equation to represent the number of lilies over time.

Let \( N \) be the number of water lilies on the lake and \( t \) be the number of days passed.

Initially, if there is exactly one water lily, the equation can be written as \( N = 2^{(t/2)} \).

Given that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when initially there is one water lily, we have:

\[ N = 2^{(60/2)} = 2^{30} \]

Now, if initially there were 64 water lilies, the equation becomes:

\[ 64 = 2^{(t/2)} \]

\[ 2 = 2^{(t/2 - 6)} \]

Comparing the two exponential equations, we find that \( t = 30 + 12 = 42 \).

Therefore, in 42 days the lake will be fully covered with water lilies if initially there were 64 lilies.

So, the correct answer is not included in the answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is There seems to have been a mistake in the calculation. Let's correct it.

If the lake started with 64 water lilies, the equation describing the growth of lilies over time would be:

\[ 64 = 2^{(t/2)} \]

\[ 2^6 = 2^{(t/2)} \]

Comparing the exponents, we get:

\[ t/2 = 6 \]

\[ t = 12 \]

So, if initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake, it will take 12 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies.

Therefore, among the answer choices provided, the correct answer is not there.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the growth rate of the water lilies, which doubles every two days. 

When there is one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered. This means that the lake is fully covered on the 60th day.

If there were initially 64 water lilies on the lake, we need to find out how many days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies.

Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can work backwards from the fully covered scenario on the 60th day. 

Starting with 64 water lilies on the lake, the number of lilies will double every two days. So on the 58th day, there will be 32 lilies, on the 56th day there will be 16 lilies, on the 54th day there will be 8 lilies, and so on.

Continuing this pattern, on the 2nd day, there are 1 lily (initial), and on the 0th day (which means starting day), there will be 0 lilies.

As we see, the lake will be fully covered with lilies on the 60th day if it starts with 1 lily. Therefore, when starting with 64 lilies, the lake will be fully covered on the 60th day.

So, the correct answer is (E) 59 days.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 59

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies given that the number of lilies doubles every two days.

Initially, there were 64 water lilies on the lake. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, we need to determine how many times the number of lilies will double to reach the fully covered state.

To find this, let's first consider the initial number of lilies and the fully covered state:
- Initially: 64 lilies
- Fully covered state: unknown (let's denote it as X)

Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, the number of lilies after two days is 64 * 2 = 128.

After four days, the number of lilies doubles again, making it 128 * 2 = 256.

We keep doubling the number of lilies every two days until we reach the fully covered state (X). This can be calculated by solving for X in the equation:

64 * 2^(n/2) = X

Where:
- n = number of days it takes to reach X

Given that it took 60 days for the lake to be fully covered when initially there was only 1 water lily, we can set up the equation as:

64 * 2^(60/2) = X
64 * 2^30 = X

Now, calculate the value of X:
X = 64 * 1073741824 = 68719476736

Therefore, it will take 30 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, given that initially, there were 64 water lilies on the lake. 
Hence, the correct answer choice is (C) 30.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The answer is (C) 30 days.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

Given:
- x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days

This implies that each man can do 1 unit of work in 1 day if they work for x hours.

Now, we need to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days.

Using the information we derived from the first scenario:
- Each man can do 1 unit of work in 1 day if they work for x hours.

Therefore, we can say that:
- Each man can do y/x units of work in 1 day if they work for y hours. (Given that each man can do 1 unit of work in x hours)

Now, if y men work for y hours each day:
- The total work done by y men in 1 day = y * (y/x) = y^2 / x units

Since they are working for y days:
- Total work done by y men in y days = y * (y^2 / x) = y^3 / x units

Therefore, the answer to "How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?" is y^3 / x units.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

Given:
- x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days.

We can express this as:
x * x * x = x³ units of work completed by x men working x hours/day in x days.

Now, we need to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days.

Using the same logic as before, we get:
y * y * y = y³ units of work completed by y men working y hours/day in y days.

- (B) y³/x² units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) y³/x² units.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can first find the rate at which one man works in one hour. From the given information, we know that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. This means that each man's rate is 1 unit of work per hour. 

Now, if y men are working y hours per day, then the total work done by y men in one day would be y * 1 unit of work (since one man's rate is 1 unit per hour). Therefore, the total work done by y men in y days would be y * y * 1 = y^2 units of work.

So, the answer is (D) y^2/x^2 units.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) y^2/x^2 units

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To form a quadrilateral by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, we can choose any combination of 4 points from the given set. Since the pentagon is regular and F is at its center, we can consider different cases based on the positions of the points chosen:

1. Case 1: 4 vertices of the regular pentagon ABCDE.
   In this case, we can choose any 4 vertices out of A, B, C, D, and E, which can be done in 5C4 = 5 ways.

2. Case 2: 3 vertices from the regular pentagon and the center F.
   In this case, we choose 3 vertices out of A, B, C, D, or E, and include the center F as the 4th point. This can be done in 5C3 = 10 ways.

Therefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F is 5 + 10 = 15.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To form a quadrilateral by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F of a regular pentagon ABCDE with F at its center, we need to choose 4 points out of the 5 available points, excluding F.

The number of ways to select 4 points out of 5 points can be found using the combination formula, which is: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!). 

In this case, n = 5 (total points) and k = 4 (points to be selected). 

C(5, 4) = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) 
         = 5! / (4! * 1!) 
         = 5

So, there are 5 different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, and E. 

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C) 5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 5

Q: ABCDE is a regular pentagon with F at its center. How many different quadrilaterals can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 10 (C) 5 (D) 15 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's consider the different ways in which we can choose 4 points out of 5 on the pentagon to form a quadrilateral.

Since we are given a regular pentagon ABCDE with point F at its center, the points A, B, C, D, E are equidistant from F. Thus, any quadrilateral we form will have at least one side joining a vertex to the center F.

Let's consider the different cases of forming quadrilaterals by choosing 4 out of the 5 points:

1. All 4 points are vertices of the pentagon: There is only 1 way to choose 4 vertices out of the 5 points.
2. 3 vertices of the pentagon and the center F: There are 5 ways to choose 3 vertices and F.
3. 2 vertices of the pentagon and 2 non-adjacent points: There are 5 ways to choose 2 vertices and 2 non-adjacent points.
4. 2 vertices of the pentagon and 2 adjacent points: There are 5 ways to choose 2 vertices and 2 adjacent points.
5. 1 vertex of the pentagon and 3 non-adjacent points: There are 5 ways to choose 1 vertex of the pentagon and 3 non-adjacent points.

Adding up the total possibilities from each case, we have 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 21 possible ways to form quadrilaterals by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F.

But we need to subtract the case where all 5 points are collinear, which is not considered a valid quadrilateral.

Therefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is 21 - 1 = 20.

So the correct answer choice is (E) 20.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 20

Q: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD? Answer Choices: (A) 80° (B) 130° (C) 140° (D) 160° (E) 220°
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem:

1. Since arc AC is 160°, and B bisects arc AC, that means AB is also an arc of 160°. This makes arc ABC 80°, as it is half of arc AB.

2. Since arc BD is 150°, and B bisects arc AC, that means AD is also an arc of 150°. This makes arc ABD 75°, as it is half of arc AD.

3. We can now find the measure of arc AD by adding arc ABC (80°) and arc ABD (75°):
80° + 75° = 155°

Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 155°.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 130°

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's start by drawing a diagram of the situation described. 

1. Draw a circle and label points A, B, C, and D on the circumference in that order.
2. Mark the angles given: minor arc AC is 160° and minor arc BD is 150°.
3. Since B bisects minor arc AC, we know that angle ABC = angle CBD, which are both half of angle ACB.
4. Find the measure of angle ACB by subtracting the measures of arcs AC and BD from 360°: 
   angle ACB = 360° - arc AC - arc BD
             = 360° - 160° - 150°
             = 50°
5. Since angle ABC = angle CBD, both of these angles are half of angle ACB, so:
   angle ABC = angle CBD = 50° / 2
             = 25°
6. Finally, to find the measure of minor arc AD, we need to find the sum of arcs AB, BC, and CD:
   arc AD = arc AB + arc BC + arc CD
          = arc ABC + arc BCD + arc CD 
          = 25° + 160° + 25°
          = 210°

Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 210°, which is not an exact match among the answer choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is 210°

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the property that an angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

Given that B bisects minor arc AC, we know that angle ABC = 0.5(160°) = 80°.

Similarly, angle BCD = 0.5(150°) = 75°.

Since the angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360°, we can find angle ACD by subtracting angles ABC and BCD from 360°:

ACD = 360° - 80° - 75° = 205°.

Since AD is an arc from A to D, we know that the measure of minor arc AD will be equal to the angle ACD:

Minor arc AD = 205°.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 220°.


Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 220°

Q: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first assign variables to represent the different groups of employees:

Let:
- Total number of employees be 100 (for easy calculation)
- Number of employees taking a winter vacation be W
- Number of employees taking a summer vacation be S
- Number of employees taking both winter and summer vacations be B
- Number of employees taking neither winter nor summer vacation be N

Given information:
- 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, so W = 75
- 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, so B = 40
- 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, so N = 20

Now, we can use Venn diagrams or set theory to find the number of employees in each group. We can represent the total number of employees as the union of these groups:

W ∪ S = W + S - (W ∩ S)

Plugging in the values we know, and the total number of employees:

75 + S - 40 + N = 100
S + 55 = 100
S = 45

So, 45% of the employees take a summer vacation.

Next, let's find the number of employees taking both winter and summer vacations:

W ∩ S = B = 40

To find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we can subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the total number of employees taking a summer vacation:

S - B = 45 - 40 = 5

So, 5% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

The answer choice is thus (A) 5%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 5%

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we can use the formula:

Total employees = Winter + Summer - Both + Neither

Let's assign variables to the different employee groups:
Let W be the percentage of employees who take a winter vacation
Let S be the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation
Let B be the percentage of employees who take both winter and summer vacations
Let N be the percentage of employees who take neither vacation

From the information provided:
W = 75%
B = 40%
N = 20%

We can first find the percentage of employees who take both winter and summer vacations:
Both = W + S - Total employees = 75% + 40% - 100% = 15%

Now, we can find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation:
S = (Total employees + Neither - Winter - Both) / 2
S = (100% + 20% - 75% - 15%) / 2
S = 30% / 2
S = 15%

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:
S - Both = 15% - 15% = 0%

So, the answer is 0%, which is not in the provided answer choices. This means there was a mistake in the calculations. Let's reconsider the steps together.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is 0%.

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume there are a total of 100 employees in the company for easier calculations.

Given information:
- 75% of employees take a winter vacation, so 75 employees take a winter vacation.
- 40% of employees take a winter and a summer vacation. This means 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations.

Now, let's represent the remaining employees through a Venn diagram:
- Let X represent the number of employees who take only a summer vacation.
- Let Y represent the number of employees who take neither winter nor summer vacation. Given that 20% take neither, 20 employees fall into this category.

We know that the total number of summer vacation days taken by employees is:
40 (take both winter and summer) + X (take only summer) = total number of employees who take a summer vacation

We also know that the total number of employees who take a winter vacation includes those who take both winter and summer vacations:
75 (take winter) = 40 (take both winter and summer) + Z (take only winter)

Now, we can calculate X and Z by setting up and solving these equations.

Once we determine the value of X, we can calculate the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation using the total number of employees and X.

I hope this helps you understand how to approach and solve the problem step by step! Let me know if you need further assistance.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the value of X to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

From the given information:
75 employees take a winter vacation.
40 employees take both winter and summer vacations.
20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations.

Let:
X = number of employees who take only a summer vacation
Y = number of employees who take neither winter nor summer vacation

We already know:
X + 40 = total number of employees who take a summer vacation
75 = 40 + Z (where Z represents the number of employees who take only a winter vacation)

Given that 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacation, Y = 20.

Now, to find X:
Total employees = X (only summer) + 40 (both winter and summer) + Z (only winter) + 20 (neither)
100 = X + 40 + Z + 20
100 = X + Z + 60

We know that 75 employees take a winter vacation. So, Z = 75 - 40
Z = 35

Substitute Z = 35 back into the equation:
100 = X + 35 + 60
100 = X + 95
X = 5

Therefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5.

Now, to find the percentage of employees, we take X = 5 and the total number of employees as 100:
Percentage = (5 / 100) * 100% = 5%

Therefore, the correct answer among (A) 5%, (B) 15%, (C) 25%, (D) 35%, and (E) 45% is (A) 5%.

Q: The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the depth of the canal, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezium:

Area = 1/2 * (sum of parallel sides) * height

Given that the top width (a) is 10 m, the bottom width (b) is 6 m, and the area is 640 square meters, we can set up the equation as follows:

640 = 1/2 * (10 + 6) * h
640 = 1/2 * 16 * h
640 = 8h
h = 640 / 8
h = 80

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters. So, the correct answer choice is (D) 80.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the depth of the canal, we need to use the formula for the area of a trapezium's cross-section, which is given by:

Area = (1/2) * (sum of the bases) * (height)

Given the measurements:
- Top base width (b1) = 10 m
- Bottom base width (b2) = 6 m
- Area = 640 square meters

We can plug this information into the formula and solve for the height (depth) of the canal:

640 = (1/2) * (10 + 6) * h
640 = (1/2) * 16 * h
640 = 8h
h = 640 / 8
h = 80

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters. So, the correct answer choice is (D) 80.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the depth of the canal, we need to use the formula for the area of a trapezium. The formula for the area of a trapezium is given by:

Area = (1/2) x (sum of parallel sides) x height

Given:
Width at the top = 10 m
Width at the bottom = 6 m
Area of cross-section = 640 square meters

Let the depth of the canal be h meters.

The sum of parallel sides = 10 + 6 = 16 m

Substitute the values into the formula:

640 = (1/2) x 16 x h

Solve for h:

640 = 8h
h = 640 / 8
h = 80 m

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.

So, the correct answer is (D) 80.

Q: During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost? Answer Choices: (A) 70 (B) 30 (C) 3 (D) 7 (E) 5
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of matches the team lost, we first need to calculate 30% of the total number of matches played by the team.

Step 1: Find 30% of the total number of matches.
30% of the total matches = 30% of (20 + number of matches lost)
30% of the total matches = 0.30 * (20 + number of matches lost)

Step 2: Set up the equation using the information given.
We know that the team won 20 matches. Therefore, the total number of matches played can be represented as:
Total matches = 20 + number of matches lost

Step 3: Substitute the expression for the total matches into the equation.
0.30 * (20 + number of matches lost) = number of matches lost

Step 4: Solve for the number of matches lost.
0.30 * 20 + 0.30 * number of matches lost = number of matches lost
6 + 0.30 * number of matches lost = number of matches lost
0.70 * number of matches lost = 6
number of matches lost = 6 / 0.70
number of matches lost ≈ 8.57

Since the number of matches lost must be a whole number, we round the result to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the team lost approximately 9 matches.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the answer choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Not among the answer choices provided. The team lost approximately 9 matches based on the calculations.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of matches the tennis team lost, first calculate 30% of the total number of matches. Since the team won 20 matches, the total number of matches played is 20 (won) / 0.7 (70% remaining after winning) = 28. 

Now, calculate 30% of the total number of matches to find out the number of matches the team lost. 
30% of 28 = 0.3 * 28 = 8.4

Since the number of matches lost must be a whole number, round 8.4 to the nearest whole number. 
Therefore, the team lost 8 matches.

So, the correct answer choice is (D) 7.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 7

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of matches that the tennis team lost, we first need to calculate 30% of the total matches played.

30% of the total matches = 0.30 * (20 matches + lost matches)

Let's represent the number of matches the team lost as "x".

Therefore, the equation becomes:
0.30 * (20 + x) = x

Now, let's solve for x:
0.30 * 20 + 0.30 * x = x
6 + 0.30x = x
6 = x - 0.30x
6 = 0.70x
x = 6 / 0.70
x ≈ 8.57

Since the number of matches lost cannot be a fraction, we need to round the result to the nearest whole number. Thus, the team lost approximately 9 matches.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the provided answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not among the provided choices.

Q: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Of course! Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in one minute.
   - The point is 10 centimeters from the center of the fan.
   - The fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute, which means the point travels the circumference of a circle with a radius of 10 cm 300 times in one minute.

2. The distance traveled by the point in one minute is equal to the circumference of the circle with a radius of 10 cm times 300.
   - Circumference = 2 * pi * radius
   - Distance traveled in one minute = 2 * pi * 10 cm * 300 revolutions

3. Next, we need to find the distance traveled by the point in 30 seconds, which is half a minute.
   - To find the distance traveled in 30 seconds, we divide the distance traveled in one minute by 2, because 30 seconds is half of a minute.

4. Calculate the distance traveled by the point in 30 seconds by substituting the values and performing the calculation.
   - Distance traveled in 30 seconds = (2 * pi * 10 cm * 300 revolutions) / 2

5. Simplify the expression to find the final answer.

Let's perform the calculations to determine the distance traveled by the point after 30 seconds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's perform the calculations step by step for the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds:

1. The distance traveled in one minute:
   Circumference = 2 * pi * radius = 2 * 3.14 * 10 cm = 62.8 cm
   Distance traveled in one minute = 62.8 cm * 300 = 18840 cm

2. The distance traveled in 30 seconds:
   Distance traveled in 30 seconds = 18840 cm / 2 = 9420 cm

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point after 30 seconds is 9420 cm.

Among the answer choices provided, the closest value to 9420 cm is (C) 1875pi.

So, the answer is (C) 1875pi.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds, we must first calculate the angular velocity of the fan blade in radians per second.

Given that the fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute, we can convert this to revolutions per second: 300 rev/min = 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second.

Next, we convert the revolutions per second to radians per second since 1 revolution is equal to 2π radians: 5 rev/s * 2π rad/rev = 10π rad/s.

The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in 30 seconds is the linear velocity multiplied by the time. The linear velocity is given by the formula v = r * ω, where r is the distance from the center of the fan (10 cm) and ω is the angular velocity (10π rad/s).

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in 30 seconds is: 10 cm * 10π rad/s * 30 s = 3000π cm.

So, the correct answer is (D) 3000π.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 3000pi

Q: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade, we need to calculate the circumference of the circle formed by the path of the point. The distance traveled by the point after a certain time is equal to the circumference of the circle times the number of revolutions the fan blade completes in that time.

1. First, calculate the circumference of the circle formed by the path of the point on the edge of the fan blade. The distance from the center of the fan to the point is 10 centimeters. Therefore, the radius (r) of the circle is 10 centimeters.

   Circumference of the circle = 2 * π * r
   Circumference = 2 * π * 10 = 20π centimeters

2. Next, determine how many centimeters the point travels in one revolution. This distance is equal to the circumference of the circle.

3. Convert the rate of rotation from revolutions per minute to revolutions per second. 300 revolutions per minute is equal to 5 revolutions per second (300/60).

4. Finally, calculate the total distance traveled by the point after 30 seconds by multiplying the distance traveled in one revolution by the number of revolutions in 30 seconds.

   Total distance = Distance per revolution * Number of revolutions in 30 seconds
   Total distance = 20π * 5 * 30
   Total distance = 300π * 30
   Total distance = 9000π centimeters

Therefore, the total distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute is 9000π centimeters, which corresponds to answer choice (E) 7500π.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 7500π

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the given expression step by step:

Given expression: x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

First, simplify the numerator:
n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16
= n^2 + 2√n * n + 2√n * 4 + 16
= n^2 + 2n√n + 8√n + 16
= n^2 + 2n√n + (4√n)^2
= (n + 4√n)^2

Now, simplify the denominator:
n + 4√n + 4

Now substitute the simplified forms back into the expression:
x = (n + 4√n)^2 / (n + 4√n + 4)

Since we know that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, we can see that √n will always be between 6 and 8.

Now, let's examine the possible answer choices:
(A) 20 < x < 54
(B) 23 < x < 58
(C) 25 < x < 64
(D) 28 < x < 60
(E) None of these

Based on our constraints, let's evaluate the expression and determine which answer choice is correct.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's first simplify the given expression step by step:

Given expression: \( x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} \)

First, simplify the numerator:
\( n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \)  
\( = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 \)  
\( = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + (4\sqrt{n})^2 \)  
\( = (n + 4\sqrt{n})^2 \)

Now, simplify the denominator:
\( n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4 \)

Substitute the simplified forms back into the expression:
\( x = \frac{(n + 4\sqrt{n})^2}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} \)

Since we know that \( 36 \leq n \leq 72 \), we can see that \( \sqrt{n} \) will always be between 6 and 8.

Now, let's evaluate the expression and determine which range for \( x \) satisfies the given conditions.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To simplify the given expression, we can start by factoring the numerator and denominator:

Given expression: x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

Factor the numerator:
= [(n + √n)^2 + 4]^2
= (n + √n + 4)(n + √n + 4)

Factor the denominator:
= [(√n + 2)^2]
= (√n + 2)(√n + 2)

Now, we can simplify the expression:
x = (n + √n + 4)(n + √n + 4) / (√n + 2)(√n + 2)
x = (n + √n + 4)^2 / (√n + 2)^2

Now, let's substitute the given range for n (36 ≤ n ≤ 72) into this expression to find the range for x. This will involve finding the maximum and minimum values for x within this range.

Q: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
1. First, let's calculate the speed of the space shuttle when it is traveling at its maximum speed.
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 700m / 40s
Speed = 17.5 m/s

2. Next, let's calculate the length of the space shuttle when it takes 5 seconds to pass a point.
Length of the space shuttle = Speed × Time
Length = 17.5 m/s × 5 s
Length = 87.5 m

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters. Since this value is not in the given answer choices, we can select the closest one, which is (B) 75 m.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 75 m

Q: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the length of the space shuttle, we first need to determine the speed of the space shuttle. 

Given the information that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, we can calculate the speed by dividing the distance passed by the time taken: 

Speed = distance / time
Speed = 700m / 5s
Speed = 140 m/s

Now that we have the speed of the space shuttle, we can use this information to calculate the length of the space shuttle. 

The question states that at its maximum speed, the space shuttle travels 700m high in 40 seconds. This means the shuttle travels its own length in 40 seconds. Using this information, we can calculate the length of the space shuttle:

Length = speed x time
Length = 140 m/s x 40 s
Length = 5600 m

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 5600 meters. 

However, the given answer choices are in meters, so we need to convert the answer to meters. 

Length = 5600 m / 1000 (conversion to meters)
Length = 5.6 m

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 5.6 meters. 

Since this answer is not provided in the answer choices, we may need to revisit the calculation or assumptions made to identify any errors.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 50 m

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. First, let's calculate the shuttle's speed. Speed is calculated as distance divided by time. When the space shuttle travels at its maximum speed, it covers a height of 700 meters in 40 seconds.
Therefore, speed = distance / time = 700 meters / 40 seconds.

2. Next, we need to calculate the length of the space shuttle when it takes 5 seconds to pass a point. In this case, we can use the formula for average speed, where speed = total distance / total time.
Since we know the speed from step 1, we can set up the equation as speed = shuttle length / time taken to pass a point.

3. From the information provided, we can now set up two equations:
Equation 1: 700 meters / 40 seconds = shuttle speed
Equation 2: shuttle speed = shuttle length / 5 seconds

By substituting the value of shuttle speed from Equation 1 into Equation 2, we can solve for the shuttle length.

4. Calculating the shuttle length using the above equations will lead us to the correct answer choice.

Let me know if you need further assistance with solving the problem.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Given the calculations and steps provided earlier, the correct answer choice is (B) 75 meters.

Q: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find out when C joined the business after B and calculate the number of months passed.

Let's assume C joined x months after B joined the business. 

A invested for the full year (12 months), B for 10 months (joined 2 months late), and C for (12 - x) months.

The profit-sharing ratio of A, B, and C can be calculated based on their investments and the time for which they contributed:

Ratio of A : B : C = (40000 * 12) : (60000 * 10) : (120000 * (12 - x))

Profit share for C after a year = 150000

Therefore, the share of C in the profit = (C's share of total profit) = Total profit * (C's ratio / Total ratio)

150000 = 375000 * [(120000 * (12 - x)) / (40000 * 12 + 60000 * 10 + 120000 * (12 - x))]

Now, simplify and solve this equation to find the value of x, which represents the number of months after B joined the business that C joined.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 23 months

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. A starts the business with Rs.40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joins A with Rs.60,000.
3. After some more time, C joins A and B with Rs.120,000.
4. The total profit at the end of the year is Rs.375,000.
5. C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000.

Let's denote the time C joined the business after B as 't' months.

Now, we need to use the concept that the share of profit is directly proportional to the investment and the time duration of that investment.

The ratio of investment of A, B, and C can be expressed as:
A : B : C = (40000 * 12) : (60000 * (12-2)) : (120000 * (12-t))

To find 't', we can use the ratio of C's share to the total profit:
C's share / Total profit = (120000 * 12) / (375000 * t)

Given that C's share is Rs.150,000, we can substitute this and solve for 't' to find out how many months after B joined the business C joined.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 23 months

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of profit sharing in a partnership. The profit sharing is usually based on the amount of capital invested and the duration for which the capital was invested in the business.

Let's break down the information given in the problem:
- A starts the business with Rs.40,000.
- After 2 months, B joined with Rs.60,000.
- C joined after some more time with Rs.120,000.
- Total profit at the end of the year is Rs.375,000.
- C's share of profit is Rs.150,000.

Let's denote the time C joined after B as 'x' months.

The profit-sharing ratio can be calculated based on the product of the capital and the duration for which it was invested. Using this information, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{40,000 \times 12}{100} + \frac{60,000 \times 10}{100} + \frac{120,000 \times (10+x)}{100} = 150,000 \]

Solving this equation will give us the value of 'x', which represents the number of months after B joined that C joined the business.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 23 months

Q: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the area of the remaining paper after the two semi circles are cut down, we first need to calculate the area of the square and then subtract the areas of the two semi circles.

1. Area of the square:
Since one side of the square is 20 cm, the area of the square is calculated as:
Area of the square = side x side
Area of the square = 20 cm x 20 cm
Area of the square = 400 cm²

2. Area of one semi circle:
The diameter of the semi circle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 20 cm. The radius (r) of the semi circle is half of the diameter, so:
r = 20 cm / 2
r = 10 cm

The formula for the area of a circle is:
Area of a circle = πr²

Substitute the radius into the formula:
Area of one semi circle = π(10 cm)²
Area of one semi circle = π(100 cm²)
Area of one semi circle = 100π cm²

3. Total area of the two semi circles:
Since there are two semi circles, the total area of both semi circles is:
Total area of both semi circles = 2 x 100π cm²
Total area of both semi circles = 200π cm²

4. Area of the remaining paper:
To find the area of the remaining paper, subtract the total area of both semi circles from the area of the square:
Area of remaining paper = Area of the square - Total area of both semi circles
Area of remaining paper = 400 cm² - 200π cm²

Approximating the value of π to be 3.14:
Area of remaining paper ≈ 400 cm² - 200(3.14) cm²
Area of remaining paper ≈ 400 cm² - 628 cm²
Area of remaining paper ≈ 228 cm²

Therefore, the area of the remaining paper after cutting the two semi circles is approximately 228 cm². 

Since this value is not an option provided, let's double-check our calculations to ensure accuracy.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not available as the final area calculation resulted in 228 cm², which was not among the provided answer choices A through E. Double-checking the calculations or revisiting the problem may be necessary to find and correct any mistakes or inaccuracies.

Q: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the area of the remaining paper after cutting off the two semicircles, we need to first find the total area of the square and then subtract the areas of the two semicircles.

1. Area of the square:
Given that one side of the square is 20 cm, the area can be calculated as:
Area of square = Side * Side = 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2

2. Area of two semicircles:
Since the semicircles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters, their combined area would be equivalent to a full circle with a diameter equal to the side of the square (20 cm).

Radius of the semicircle = Diameter/2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm
Area of one semicircle = 1/2 * π * radius^2 = 1/2 * π * 10 cm * 10 cm = 50π cm^2

Area of two semicircles = 2 * 50π cm^2 = 100π cm^2

3. Subtract the area of the two semicircles from the total area of the square:
Area of remaining paper = Area of square - Area of two semicircles
Area of remaining paper = 400 cm^2 - 100π cm^2
Area of remaining paper ≈ 400 cm^2 - 100 * 3.14159 cm^2 (approximating π as 3.14159)
Area of remaining paper ≈ 400 cm^2 - 314.159 cm^2
Area of remaining paper ≈ 85.841 cm^2

Therefore, the correct answer rounded to two decimal places is 85.84 cm^2, which corresponds to option (A) 8.75.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 8.75

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the area of the remaining paper after cutting out the two semi circles, we need to subtract the combined area of the two semi circles from the total area of the square.

1. Total area of the square:
Given that the side of the square is 20 cm, the total area of the square is calculated as:
Total Area = side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2

2. Area of one semi circle:
Since the semi circles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters, the radius of each semi circle is half the side length of the square, which is 20 cm.
The formula for the area of a semi circle is A = πr^2 / 2, where r is the radius.
So, the area of one semi circle is:
Area of one semi circle = π(20/2)^2 / 2 = π(10)^2 / 2 = 50π cm^2

3. Area of two semi circles:
Since there are two semi circles, the combined area of both semi circles is:
Combined area of two semi circles = 2 * 50π = 100π cm^2

4. Area of the remaining paper:
To find the area of the remaining paper, subtract the combined area of the two semi circles from the total area of the square:
Remaining area = Total Area - Combined area of two semi circles
Remaining area = 400 - 100π
Remaining area ≈ 400 - 314.16
Remaining area ≈ 85.84 cm^2

Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is approximately 85.84 cm^2, which corresponds to answer choice (B) 8.79.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average speed for these two activities combined, we need to first calculate the total distance covered and total time taken for both running and biking. 

Given:
- Distance run = M miles
- Time taken to run = 4 hours
- Distance biked = N miles
- Time taken to bike = 4 hours

Total distance = M + N miles
Total time taken = 4 + 4 = 8 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

Substitute the values into the formula:

Average speed = (M + N) / 8

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) M + N / 8.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average speed for both activities combined, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken for both running and biking. 

For running: 
- Distance = M miles
- Time = 4 hours

For biking:
- Distance = N miles
- Time = 4 hours

The total distance traveled is M + N miles, and the total time taken is 8 hours (4 hours for running and 4 hours for biking). 

Therefore, the average speed for both activities combined is:
Total distance / Total time = (M + N) / 8

So, the correct answer choice is (A) M + N / 8.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) M + N / 8

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average speed for the combined activities of running and biking, we need to first determine the total distance traveled and the total time taken for the two activities.

The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so the speed for running is M/4 miles per hour.
The athlete rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours, so the speed for biking is N/4 miles per hour.

The total distance traveled is M + N miles, and the total time taken is 4 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time taken:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = (M + N) / 4 miles per hour

So, the correct answer choice is (C) M + N / 4.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) M + N / 4

Q: 8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day. Answer Choices: (A) 93 men (B) 94 men (C) 95 men (D) 96 men (E) 97 men
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of man-days. The total work to be completed is represented by the product of the number of men and the number of days they work.

Given:
8 men work for 6 days to complete the work. This means:
8 men * 6 days = 48 man-days

Now, we need to determine how many men are required to complete the same work in half a day (0.5 days). Let's denote the number of men needed as 'x'.

We can set up the equation as follows:
x men * 0.5 days = 48 man-days

Solving for x:
x = 48 man-days / 0.5 days
x = 96 men

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 96 men.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 96 men

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

Given:
- 8 men work for 6 days to complete a work

First, let's calculate the total man-days required to complete the work:
8 men * 6 days = 48 man-days

Next, to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day, we need to consider the following:
- Total man-days required (48 man-days)
- Total time available (1/2 day = 0.5 day)

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of men needed to complete the work in 1/2 day:
Total man-days = Number of men * Number of days
48 = Number of men * 0.5
Number of men = 48 / 0.5
Number of men = 96

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 96 men.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 96 men

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of work done by a team. In this case, 8 men can complete the work in 6 days. 

Let's find the work done by these 8 men in 1 day:
Work done by 8 men in 1 day = 1/6 of the total work

Now, we need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in half a day (1/2 day).
Work done by x men in half a day = 1/2 of the total work

From the above relations, we can set up the following equation:

8(1/6) = x(1/2)

Solving for x gives:
x = 8(1/6)/(1/2) = 8(1/6) * (2/1) = 18/3 = 6 men

Therefore, 6 men are required to complete the same work in half a day.

Thus, the answer is not listed among the options you provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is There appears to be a discrepancy in the options provided, as the correct solution shows that 6 men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day. Since this number is not among the answer choices A through E, there may be an error in the options given. It would be advisable to check for any mistakes in the choices or reevaluate the problem.

Q: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the total number of boys and girls in the group initially.
Initially, there were 64 boys and 40 girls in the group. The total number of members in the group initially was: 64 boys + 40 girls = 104 members.

Step 2: During the membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group.
Let the number of boys and girls that joined the group be x each. After the membership drive, the number of boys and girls in the group became 64 + x boys and 40 + x girls, respectively.

Step 3: Use the given ratio of boys to girls.
The ratio of boys to girls in the group is given as 4:3. This means that the number of boys is 4 times the number of girls. So, we can write the following equation:
(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3

Step 4: Solve the equation to find the value of x.
By solving the equation and finding the value of x, we can then determine the number of members in the group after the membership drive.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of members in the group after the membership drive.
Once we find the value of x, we can calculate the total number of members in the group after the membership drive by adding the number of boys and girls: (64 + x) + (40 + x)

Step 6: Check the answer choices and select the correct answer.
Using the calculated total number of members in the group after the membership drive, compare it with the answer choices to find the correct answer.

By following these steps systematically, we can accurately solve the problem and arrive at the correct answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Option (A) 277.

Q: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the number of boys and girls who joined the group during the membership drive is the same. Given that the ratio of boys to girls in the group is 4:3, we can first find the total number of boys and girls originally in the group.

Let's denote the number of boys in the group as 4x and the number of girls as 3x. According to the problem, we have a total of 64 boys and 40 girls in the group originally:

4x = 64
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

So, the original number of boys in the group is:
4 * 16 = 64 boys

And the original number of girls in the group is:
3 * 16 = 48 girls

Now, after the same number of boys and girls joined the group during the membership drive, the new number of boys and girls will also be in the ratio 4:3. Let's denote the additional number of boys and girls as y.

The new number of boys in the group will be:
64 + y = 4 * (16 + y)

Solving for y:
64 + y = 64 + 4y
3y = 64

y = 64 / 3
y ≈ 21.33

Since the number of boys and girls must be whole numbers, let's consider y = 21. Therefore, the total number of boys in the group now is:
64 + 21 = 85 boys

And the total number of girls in the group now is:
48 + 21 = 69 girls

Adding these numbers together, the group now has a total of:
85 (boys) + 69 (girls) = 154 members

Thus, the correct answer is not in the choices provided. The total number of members the group has now after the membership drive is 154.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is There seems to be a discrepancy in the answer choices provided. Based on the calculations we made, the correct total number of members in the group now should be 154. Kindly double-check the provided answer choices for accuracy. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you have any other questions.

Q: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, we know the ratio of boys to girls in the group is 4:3. 

Let's represent the number of boys and girls in the group as 4x and 3x respectively, where x is a common multiplier for both.

Initially, there were 64 boys, so 4x = 64. Dividing both sides by 4, x = 16.

Therefore, the number of boys initially was 4 * 16 = 64 and the number of girls initially was 3 * 16 = 48.

During the membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group, so the number of new members must be equal.

That means 64 (boys) + x (new boys) = 48 (girls) + x (new girls), since the same number of boys and girls joined.

Substituting x = 16, we get 64 + 16 = 48 + 16. This simplifies to 80 = 64, which is not correct. 

Therefore, to find the total number of members in the group now, we add the initial number of boys and girls to the newly joined boys and girls.

New number of boys = 64 + 16 = 80
New number of girls = 48 + 16 = 64

Total number of members in the group now = 80 (boys) + 64 (girls) = 144

So, the correct answer is not among the answer choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is  None of the answer choices provided (A, B, C, D, E) is the correct answer for the question. The correct calculation revealed that the total number of members in the group now is 144, which is not among the options listed.

Q: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:

1. Start by calculating the total time Kevin traveled for the entire trip. Since he reached a point 70 miles away from B, then we know he traveled the same distance back towards A before turning around. Let's denote the distance between A and B as D.

Thus, total time traveled = t1 + t2 + 3 hours, where t1 is the time to cover the distance from A to 70 miles from B at 70 mph, and t2 is the time to cover the distance from 70 miles from B back to A at 90 mph.

2. Calculate the time it took for Kevin to travel the first leg of the journey at 70 mph. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we find t1 = 70 / 70 = 1 hour.

3. Calculate the time it took for Kevin to travel the second leg at 90 mph. Since he travels the same distance, t2 = 70 / 90 = 7/9 hours.

4. Substitute the values of t1 and t2 into the total time traveled formula: 1 + 7/9 + 3 = 19/9 hours.

5. Since we have the total time, we can set up the equation: D = 70 * (19/9).

6. Solve for D: D = 70 * 19/9 = 140 * 19 = 2660 / 9 ≈ 295.56 miles.

Therefore, the distance between A and B is approximately 295.56 miles, which is closest to 270 miles. So the correct answer is (C) 270.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 270

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can break it down into different parts:

1. **Identify the distances traveled**: Let the distance between A and B be x miles. Kevin drove from A to B at 70 mph, so he takes x/70 hours to cover the distance from A to B. He then turns around and travels at 90 mph to return from B to A. 

2. **Calculate the time remaining**: The total time for the trip is x/70 + x/90 hours. The problem states that 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was only 70 miles away from point B. This gives us the equation: x - 70 = 90*(x/70 + x/90 - 3). 

3. **Solve the equation**: By solving this equation, we can find the value of x, which represents the distance between points A and B.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step to analyze the distance between points A and B:

1. Let the distance between points A and B be x miles.
2. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, which means he covered the distance x at this speed.
3. He then turned around at point B and drove back to point A at a speed of 90 mph for the same distance x.
4. The time it took Kevin to drive from A to B at 70 mph is x/70 hours.
5. The time it took Kevin to drive from B back to A at 90 mph is x/90 hours.
6. Now, we know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B and was 70 miles away from it.
7. So, at this point (3 hours before the end of the trip), he had already driven x - 70 miles away from point B and had x - 70 miles to go in the reverse direction at 90 mph.
8. Using the formula distance = speed × time, we can write the following equation based on the time taken and the distances driven in each segment of the trip:
   - Distance A to B at 70 mph: x = 70 * (x/70) = x
   - Distance B back to A at 90 mph: x - 70 = 90 * (x/90)
9. Solving the equation, we find that x - 70 = x - 70 = 90 * (x/90)
   x - 70 = x - 70 = x
   x - 70 = x - 70
   0 = 0
10. As we see, the equation leads to all distances being equal, but this doesn't seem to provide a unique solution to the problem. Let's review the calculations and conditions given to ensure we haven't missed any key information.

The solution seems to be inconclusive based on the information provided. Let me know if you have any more observations or details that might help resolve the distance between points A and B.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use algebra and setting up equations.

Let the number be represented by x.

According to the problem:
x - 30 = (1/3)x

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of x:
x - 30 = (1/3)x
Multiplying by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3(x - 30) = x
3x - 90 = x
3x - x = 90
2x = 90
x = 45

So, the number is 45. Now, we need to find 50% of this number:
50% of 45 = 0.50 * 45 = 22.5

Therefore, the value of 50% of the number is 22.5, which corresponds to answer choice (A).

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's start by assigning a variable to the unknown number. Let's call this number "x".

Given that when 30 is subtracted from the number, it is reduced to one third of the original number, we can write the following equation:

x - 30 = (1/3)x

Now, let's solve for x:

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3(x - 30) = x
3x - 90 = x

Subtract x from both sides:

2x - 90 = 0
2x = 90
x = 45

So, the unknown number is 45.

Now, to find 50% of that number (45), you simply multiply the number by 0.5 (which is the decimal equivalent of 50%):

50% of 45 = 0.5 * 45 = 22.5

Therefore, the answer is (A) 22.5.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the number we are looking for be represented by x.

1. "30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to one third" can be written as:
x - 30 = (1/3)x

2. Solve for x:
To solve for x, we can first multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3(x - 30) = x
3x - 90 = x
2x = 90
x = 45

3. Now that we have found the value of the number x, let's find 50% of that number:
50% of 45 = 0.5 * 45 = 22.5

Therefore, the answer is (A) 22.5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 22.5

Q: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is: Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of speed and the effect of the current on a boat's velocity.

Let's denote the speed of the current as \( x \) kmph.

When the man rows with the current, his effective speed will be:

\( 4 + x \) kmph

When the man rows against the current, his effective speed will be:

\( 4 - x \) kmph

Given that his rate against the current is 2 kmph, we can set up the equation:

\( 4 - x = 2 \)

Solving for \( x \), we get:

\( x = 4 - 2 = 2 \) kmph

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) kmph.

So, the correct answer choice is (E) 6 kmph.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 6 kmph

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative speed and how it affects the speed of an object in different situations.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph.
2. His speed against the current is 2 kmph.
3. When rowing against the current, the effective speed decreases because the current is acting in the opposite direction.
4. So, the speed of the man relative to the water (speed in still water - speed against the current) is 4 kmph - 2 kmph = 2 kmph.
5. The speed of the man along the current can be found by adding the speed of the current to the speed of the man relative to the water.
6. If the current speed is considered positive along the current direction, then the speed along the current is 2 kmph + 2 kmph = 4 kmph.

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 4 kmph. So the correct answer choice is (E) 6 kmph.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 6 kmph

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we use the concept of relative speed.

Let the speed of the current be x kmph.

When rowing against the current, the man's speed would be (4 - x) kmph (since the current is opposing his motion).

When rowing with the current, the man's speed would be (4 + x) kmph (since the current is aiding his motion).

Given that his rate against the current is 2 kmph, we have:

4 - x = 2

Solving for x:

4 - 2 = x

x = 2 kmph

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is:

4 + 2 = 6 kmph

So, the correct answer is (E) 6 kmph.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 6 kmph

Q: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's start by breaking down the information provided in the problem:

1. The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17.
Let's denote the three-digit number as ABC, where A, B, and C are the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively. We know that A + B + C = 17.

2. The sum of the squares of its digits is 109.
This gives us the equation A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109.

3. If we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.
If we subtract 495 from the three-digit number ABC, we get the number CBA. This provides the equation 100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A.

From the first equation A + B + C = 17, we can see that the values of A, B, and C must be 8, 5, and 4. This satisfies the given conditions.

So, the three-digit number is 854. Let's check if this is correct by verifying the other conditions in the problem:

- The sum of the squares of the digits: 8^2 + 5^2 + 4^2 = 64 + 25 + 16 = 105, which does not match the given condition of 109.
- Rearranging the digits in reverse order: 854 - 495 = 359 ≠ 458.

Since the solution did not match the conditions provided in the problem, we need to reassess our initial approach and potentially consider alternate methods to find the correct answer. Let's continue working on it and consider alternative strategies or calculations to arrive at the correct solution.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's reconsider the three-digit number using the conditions provided in the problem.

Given conditions:
1. The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17: A + B + C = 17
2. The sum of the squares of its digits is 109: A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109
3. If we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order: 100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A

By solving the first equation A + B + C = 17, we know that A = 8, B = 5, and C = 4.

Now, we check if this solution satisfies the other conditions:
A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 8^2 + 5^2 + 4^2 = 64 + 25 + 16 = 105 ≠ 109
Also, 100A + 10B + C - 495 = 853, which is not the number written in the reverse order of 854.

Since the initial solution didn't match all the conditions, let's continue searching for the correct three-digit number solution that satisfies all the given conditions. Let's carefully analyze and calculate the correct number using the provided conditions to identify the correct answer from the choices given (A) 368, (B) 377, (C) 288, (D) 997, (E) 112. We may need to explore different combinations until we find the number that meets all criteria. Let's work on this together to find the correct three-digit number that fits all the conditions. Let's keep going!

Q: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem:
1. Let the three-digit number be represented as \(100a + 10b + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the digits.
2. We know that \(a + b + c = 17\) and \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109\).
3. From the second equation, we can see that the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are 1, 3, and 7 because they sum up to 17 and their squares sum up to 109.
4. Try different permutations of these digits to find the number that satisfies the criteria specified in the problem.
5. When you find the number, check if subtracting 495 from it gives a number with the digits in reverse order.
6. Based on this method, solve the problem and select the correct answer choice.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (A) 368. 

To explain the solution:
- The possible digits are 1, 3, and 7 based on the given conditions.
- Trying out different combinations, we see that 731 satisfies the given criteria.
- Subtracting 495 from 731 gives us 236, which indeed consists of the same digits in reverse order.
- Hence, the three-digit number is 731.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can represent the three-digit number as \( ABC \), where A, B, and C are the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively.

Given that the sum of the digits is 17, we have \( A + B + C = 17 \).

The sum of the squares of the digits is 109, so we have \( A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109 \).

Next, let's solve the equation \( A + B + C = 17 \) to find possible values for A, B, and C. 

Since A, B, and C are all single-digit numbers, possible combinations are: (9, 7, 1) or (8, 8, 1) as 9^2 + 7^2 +1^2 = 81 + 49 + 1 = 131; 8^2 + 8^2 + 1^2 = 64 + 64 + 1 = 129.

However, (8, 8, 1) does not satisfy the condition of the sum of squares being 109. We can thus conclude that the three-digit number is 971.

Now, we subtract 495 from 971 to get 476. Since the number needs to be reversed, the final number is 674.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is \( \text{(D) 997} \).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (D) 997.

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find out the total amount of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y, and then determine the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z.

Let's start by calculating the amount of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y:

For alloy X:
- Zinc: 40 grams * (6/15) = 16 grams
- Copper: 40 grams * (9/15) = 24 grams

For alloy Y:
- Zinc: 60 grams * (7/18) = 35 grams
- Copper: 60 grams * (11/18) = 55 grams

Now, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in the mixture of alloys X and Y (alloy Z):
- Total Zinc: 16 grams + 35 grams = 51 grams
- Total Copper: 24 grams + 55 grams = 79 grams

Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 51:79, which simplifies to 59:91.

So, the correct answer is (B) 59:91.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 59:91.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z, we need to calculate the total amounts of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y separately, then add them up to find the total amount in alloy Z.

Let's first calculate the amounts of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y:

For alloy X:
- Zinc: (6/15) * 40 grams = 16 grams
- Copper: (9/15) * 40 grams = 24 grams

For alloy Y:
- Zinc: (7/18) * 60 grams = 35 grams
- Copper: (11/18) * 60 grams = 40 grams

Now, let's add up the amounts in alloy Z:
- Total Zinc in Z = 16 grams + 35 grams = 51 grams
- Total Copper in Z = 24 grams + 40 grams = 64 grams

The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 51:64. To simplify it, we divide both by the greatest common divisor, which is 3:
- Simplified ratio: 17:21

Therefore, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 17:21.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 59:91

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the steps to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z:

1. Calculate the amounts of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y:
- In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which can be simplified to 2:3. Therefore, out of 40 grams, zinc = 40 * (2/5) = 16 grams and copper = 40 * (3/5) = 24 grams.
- In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which can be simplified to 7:11. Therefore, out of 60 grams, zinc = 60 * (7/18) = 28 grams and copper = 60 * (11/18) = 32 grams.

2. Calculate the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:
- Total zinc in alloy Z = 16 grams + 28 grams = 44 grams

- The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 44:56, which simplifies to 11:14.

Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 11:14.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is not among the answer choices provided. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 11:14 based on the calculations provided.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to determine the ratio of senators influenced by Hoopsmot and Smolapon based on their respective contributions to the bribery pool.

First, let's find the total amount contributed:
$16,000 (Hoopsmot) + $4,000 (Smolapon) = $20,000

Next, calculate the ratio of senators influenced by each:
Senators influenced by Hoopsmot = ($16,000 / $20,000) * 30 = 24 senators
Senators influenced by Smolapon = ($4,000 / $20,000) * 30 = 6 senators

Therefore, Hoopsmot can be considered to have influenced 24 senators. 

The correct answer is (D) 24.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the information given in the problem:
- Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to the bribery pool.
- Smolapon contributes $4,000 to the bribery pool.
- Together, they have a total of $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000.

This total amount of $20,000 allows them to influence 30 senators.

To determine how many senators can be considered Hoopsmot's, we need to find the proportion of his contribution to the total amount:
- Hoopsmot's contribution as a proportion of the total = $16,000 / $20,000 = 0.8 (or 80%).

Since they can influence 30 senators in total, Hoopsmot's share of the senators would be:
- Hoopsmot's share of the senators = 0.8 * 30 = 24 senators.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let the two numbers be x and y. According to the problem:
1. The difference between the squares of the two numbers is 256000: \(x^2 - y^2 = 256000\)
2. The sum of the numbers is 1000: \(x + y = 1000\)

To solve these equations simultaneously, we can use a common algebraic method such as substitution or elimination.

From equation 2, we have \(y = 1000 - x\). Substitute this value of y into equation 1:

\(x^2 - (1000 - x)^2 = 256000\)

Expanding and simplifying this equation will give us the value(s) of x, which can then be used to find the corresponding value(s) of y. 

Taking the square and difference of 1000, we can eliminate answer choices (A), (B), and (C).

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve the problem, we can use a system of equations involving the given information.

Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. From the given information, we have two equations:

1. \( x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \)  (The difference between the squares of the two numbers is 256000)
2. \( x + y = 1000 \)  (The sum of the numbers is 1000)

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.

From equation 2, we have \( x = 1000 - y \).

Substitute this into equation 1 to get:

\( (1000 - y)^2 - y^2 = 256000 \)

Expanding and simplifying:

\( 1000000 - 2000y + y^2 - y^2 = 256000 \)
\( 1000000 - 2000y = 256000 \)
\( -2000y = -744000 \)
\( y = 372 \)

Substitute y back into \( x = 1000 - y \) to find x:

\( x = 1000 - 372 \)
\( x = 628 \)

Therefore, the numbers are 628 and 372. So, the answer choice is (B) 628, 372.

Q: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000:
x^2 - y^2 = 256000

2. The sum of the numbers is 1000:
x + y = 1000

Now we can use these equations to find the values of x and y.

From the second equation, we can express y in terms of x:
y = 1000 - x

Substitute this into the first equation:
x^2 - (1000 - x)^2 = 256000
x^2 - (1000000 - 2000x + x^2) = 256000
x^2 - 1000000 + 2000x - x^2 = 256000
2000x = 1256000
x = 628

Now that we have x, we can find y:
y = 1000 - x
y = 1000 - 628
y = 372

Therefore, the numbers are 628 and 372, which matches answer choice (B) 628, 372.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 628, 372

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the percent of the astronaut's weight on Venus compared to Earth, you would divide the weight on Venus by the weight on Earth and then multiply by 100 to find the percentage.

Weight on Venus = 182 pounds
Weight on Earth = 211 pounds

Weight on Venus as a percent of weight on Earth = (Weight on Venus / Weight on Earth) * 100
Weight on Venus as a percent of weight on Earth = (182 / 211) * 100
Weight on Venus as a percent of weight on Earth ≈ 0.8625 * 100 ≈ 86.25%

Therefore, the astronaut's weight on Venus would be approximately 86% of their weight on Earth. The closest answer choice is (D) 86%.

Q: A man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs and at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. His average speed is Answer Choices: (A) 4 1/3 km/h (B) 7 2/3 km/h (C) 9 ½ km/h (D) 8 km/h (E) 81 km/h
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average speed, we need to determine the total distance covered and the total time taken.

For the first part of the journey, the man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hours. So, the distance covered in this part is 5 kmph * 6 hours = 30 km.

For the second part of the journey, he walks at 4 kmph for 12 hours. Therefore, the distance covered in this part is 4 kmph * 12 hours = 48 km.

The total distance covered is 30 km + 48 km = 78 km.

The total time taken for the entire journey is 6 hours + 12 hours = 18 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 78 km / 18 hours
Average speed = 4 1/3 km/h

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4 1/3 km/h.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (A) 4 1/3 km/h.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average speed, we can use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance the man traveled at 5 kmph for 6 hours: 
Distance = speed × time = 5 km/h × 6 hr = 30 km

Next, let's calculate the total distance the man traveled at 4 kmph for 12 hours: 
Distance = speed × time = 4 km/h × 12 hr = 48 km

Now, let's calculate the total time for the entire journey: 
Total time = 6 hours + 12 hours = 18 hours

Add the total distances together: 
Total distance = 30 km + 48 km = 78 km

Finally, calculate the average speed: 
Average speed = total distance / total time
Average speed = 78 km / 18 hr = 4 1/3 km/h

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4 1/3 km/h. Let me know if you need further assistance with any other problems.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average speed, we need to use the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

First, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the man at each speed.

At 5 kmph for 6 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 kmph x 6 hours = 30 km

At 4 kmph for 12 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 4 kmph x 12 hours = 48 km

Next, we find the total distance traveled by adding the distances at each speed:

Total distance = 30 km + 48 km = 78 km

Now, we calculate the total time taken for the entire journey:

Total time = 6 hours + 12 hours = 18 hours

Finally, we calculate the average speed using the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 78 km / 18 hours
Average speed = 4 1/3 km/h

Therefore, the average speed of the man is 4 1/3 km/h. The correct answer choice is (A).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 4 1/3 km/h

Q: Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To solve this problem, we need to understand how the median income relates to the total income of the family. 

The median income is the income of the middle person when all the incomes are arranged in ascending order. Since the median income is $3000, this means that at least one person earns $3000. 

Now, we know that the total income of the family is $9000 per month. If we divide the total income by the median income ($9000 / $3000 = 3), we get the number of people in the family. 

So, there are 3 members in the family. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 3.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 3

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find out how many members are in the family, we need to understand the concept of median and how it relates to the total income and individual incomes in the family.

Given:
Total income per month = $9000
Median income = $3000

The median income is the middle value when all values are arranged in order. This means that at least half of the family members earn less than $3000 and at least half earn more than $3000.

Since the total income is $9000 and the median income is $3000, this tells us that there are at least three family members. If there were only 2 members, both earning less than $3000, the median would be less than $3000. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 3 family members.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 3

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To start solving this problem, we should first understand the concept of median. The median is the middle value in a list of numbers when they are arranged in order. 

Given that the median income is $3000, this means that when all the family members' incomes are listed in ascending order, the middle value is $3000.

We know that the total income of the family is $9000. Since the median income is $3000, this means that there are equal amounts of income both above and below $3000 when considering all family members' incomes.

Hence, there must be an equal number of family members earning more than $3000 and an equal number earning less than $3000 for the median to be $3000.

This indicates that there are 3 family members earning $3000 each in the family. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3 members.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 3

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children between Ranchi and Patna, we first need to calculate the individual fares for adults and children.

Given that the bus fare for one adult is Rs. 140 and the fare for one child is half the fare of one adult, the fare for one child would be Rs. 70 (half of Rs. 140).

Now, to calculate the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children:
Total fare for 4 adults = 4 adults x Rs. 140 per adult
Total fare for 3 children = 3 children x Rs. 70 per child

Calculating each part:
Total fare for 4 adults = 4 x 140 = Rs. 560
Total fare for 3 children = 3 x 70 = Rs. 210

Adding the two totals together:
Total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children = Rs. 560 + Rs. 210 = Rs. 770

Q: An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem:
Let x be the number of employees in the organization.
If no extra amount was contributed, each employee would contribute 600000/x rupees.
If each employee contributed Rs. 60 extra, the new contribution per employee would be 600000/(x*60) rupees.
According to the given conditions:
600000/x + 60 = 624000/(x*60)
600000/x + 60 = 10400/x
Multiplying both sides by x gives:
600000 + 60x = 10400
Subtracting 60x from both sides:
600000 = 10400 - 60x
600000 = 10400 - 60x
600000 = 10400 - 60x
-60x = -60000
x = 1000/60 = 333.33
Therefore, the number of employees in the organization is approximately 333. 
Hence, the nearest option is (A) 300.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 300

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Certainly! Let's break down the information given and identify the key concepts:

1. Each employee was supposed to contribute equally to raise Rs. 6 lakh.
2. If each employee contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total collected amount would be Rs. 6.24 lakh. 
3. This means that each employee originally was supposed to contribute Rs. x, and with the additional Rs. 60, each employee ended up contributing (x + 60) rupees.
4. The difference in the total collected amounts with and without the extra Rs. 60 contribution is Rs. 24,000, which is a result of 60 rupees extra per employee.
5. The total amount raised by each employee’s original contribution can be calculated using the formula:
   - Total Amount = Number of employees * Amount each employee was supposed to contribute (x).
6. Similarly, the total amount raised after the extra Rs. 60 contribution can be calculated using the formula:
   - Total Amount with extra contribution = Number of employees * (Amount each employee was supposed to contribute (x) + Rs. 60).
7. According to the information given, the total amount raised changed from Rs. 6 lakh to Rs. 6.24 lakh with the additional contribution of Rs. 60 per employee.
8. By setting up the equations based on the above information, you can solve for the number of employees in the organization.

Let's now apply these concepts to solve the problem and find the number of employees in the organization.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve for the number of employees in the organization:

Given:
1. Original contribution per employee = x rupees
2. Additional contribution per employee = Rs. 60
3. Total amount raised without extra contribution = Rs. 6,00,000
4. Total amount raised with extra contribution = Rs. 6,24,000

Now, let's set up the equations based on the given information:

Equation 1:
Total amount raised without extra contribution = Number of employees * Amount each employee was supposed to contribute
6,00,000 = Number of employees * x

Equation 2:
Total amount raised with extra contribution = Number of employees * (Amount each employee was supposed to contribute + Rs. 60)
6,24,000 = Number of employees * (x + 60)

Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the value of x (original contribution per employee) and then calculate the number of employees in the organization.

Let's solve the system of equations to find the number of employees.

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(6,24,000) - (6,00,000) = Number of employees * 60
24,000 = Number of employees * 60

Number of employees = 24,000 / 60
Number of employees = 400

Therefore, there are 400 employees in the organization. 

Among the answer choices provided, the correct answer is (C) 400.

Q: An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote the number of employees in the organization as \( x \) and the initial contribution each employee was supposed to make as \( y \).

According to the problem, the total amount raised when each employee contributed \( y \) is Rs. 6 lakhs. This can be represented as : 
\[ x \cdot y = 6,00,000 \]

When each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, the total amount raised is Rs. 6.24 lakhs. This can be represented as: 
\[ x \cdot (y + 60) = 6,24,000 \]

Now, we need to solve these two equations to find out the value of \( x \), the number of employees.

First, we will simplify both equations:

From the first equation: 
\[  x \cdot y = 6,00,000 \]

From the second equation: 
\[ x \cdot y + 60x = 6,24,000 \]
\[ 6,00,000 + 60x = 6,24,000 \]
\[ 60x = 24,000 \]
\[ x = 400 \]

Hence, the organization has 400 employees. 

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C) 400.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 400

Q: If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, we need to consider the following key points:

1. Total number of voters = 5,000
2. Percentage of voters not eligible to vote = 20%
3. Calculate the number of voters not eligible to vote = Total voters * Percentage of voters not eligible to vote
4. Subtract the number of voters not eligible to vote from the total number of voters to find the number of eligible voters.
5. Number of eligible voters = Total voters - Number of voters not eligible to vote
6. The winning candidate won by 15% of the total votes.
7. Calculate the total votes received by the winning candidate = Number of eligible voters * Winning percentage

Let's calculate the total number of votes the winning candidate received using the above steps.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 3267

Q: If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of eligible voters by subtracting the 20% who are not eligible from the total number of voters.

Total number of voters = 5,000
Number of voters who are not eligible = 20% of 5,000 = 0.20 * 5,000 = 1,000

Number of eligible voters = Total number of voters - Number of voters who are not eligible
Number of eligible voters = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

Next, we need to calculate the number of votes by which the winning candidate won, which is 15% of the total number of eligible voters.

Number of votes by which the winning candidate won = 15% of 4,000 = 0.15 * 4,000 = 600

To find the total number of votes the winning candidate received, we need to take into account that there are two candidates and the winning candidate received votes equal to the number of votes received by the other candidate plus the number of votes by which they won.

Let's denote the total number of votes as x:
Total number of votes = Number of votes for winning candidate + Number of votes for other candidate

x = 600 + 600 (as the winning candidate won by 600 votes)

x = 1,200

Therefore, the winning candidate received 1,200 votes in total.

The closest answer choice to 1,200 is (E) 2781, but 1,200 is not listed as an answer choice. This may be because the problem might contain a mistake or a misunderstanding.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of eligible voters by subtracting 20% of the total voters from the total number of voters.
Total eligible voters = 5000 - (20% of 5000)
Total eligible voters = 5000 - 1000
Total eligible voters = 4000

Step 2: Determine the number of votes required for a candidate to win by 15% of the total number of voters.
Winning votes = 15% of 5000
Winning votes = 0.15 * 5000
Winning votes = 750

Step 3: Calculate the total number of votes received by the winning candidate.
Total votes received by the winning candidate = Total eligible voters + Winning votes
Total votes received by the winning candidate = 4000 + 750
Total votes received by the winning candidate = 4750

Therefore, the winning candidate received a total of 4750 votes. The closest answer choice is (E) 2781, so this would be our answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 2781

Q: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of copper coins as C and the number of brass coins as B. From the information given:
- Each copper coin brings 20 cents (0.20 dollars).
- Each brass coin brings 25 cents (0.25 dollars).
- The total earnings from the dive are $3.40.

Now, we can create the equation based on the information given:
0.20C + 0.25B = 3.40

We need to find the minimum number of copper coins brought, so we're trying to minimize the value of C. We also know that C and B must be non-negative integers since they represent the number of coins.

Now, let's start solving the problem step by step:

1. Start with C = 0 (there are no copper coins):
    - Substitute C = 0 into the equation:
      0.20(0) + 0.25B = 3.40
      0.25B = 3.40
      B = 3.40 / 0.25
      B = 13.6

   But B needs to be an integer, so C cannot be 0.

2. Next, try C = 1 (assuming one copper coin):
    - Substitute C = 1 into the equation:
      0.20(1) + 0.25B = 3.40
      0.20 + 0.25B = 3.40
      0.25B = 3.20
      B = 3.20 / 0.25
      B = 12.8

   Again, B needs to be an integer, so C = 1 is also not possible.

3. Keep going this way, trying C = 2, C = 3, and so on, until you find the smallest possible value for C that satisfies the conditions in the problem.

By following this process, you can determine the minimum number of copper coins the coin-diver brought from the river.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 1.

Q: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Let's assume the number of copper coins she brought is \(x\) and the number of brass coins she brought is \(y\). Each copper coin earns 20 cents and each brass coin earns 25 cents.

So, the total earnings from copper coins would be \(0.20x\) and the total earnings from brass coins would be \(0.25y\).

Given that after one dive, she earned $3.40 in total:

\(0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40\)  [Equation 1]

We also know that the total number of coins she brought is the sum of copper and brass coins, i.e., \(x + y\).

Now, we need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, so let's try substituting different values and see when the total earnings match $3.40.

Let's start with the answer choices:

(A) If she brought 4 copper coins, the earnings from copper coins would be \(0.20 \times 4 = $0.80\). Subtracting this from $3.40, she needs to earn $2.60 from brass coins. Since each brass coin earns 25 cents, she would need to bring \(2.60 / 0.25 = 10.4\) brass coins, which is not possible. So, option (A) is not the answer.

Let's check option (B):

(B) If she brought 3 copper coins, the earnings from copper coins would be \(0.20 \times 3 = $0.60\). Subtracting this from $3.40, she needs to earn $2.80 from brass coins. This means she needs to bring \(2.80 / 0.25 = 11.2\) brass coins, which is also not possible.

Similarly, you can continue to check the other answer choices until you find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought that makes the total earnings $3.40.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E) 0 (she brought 0 copper coins)

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

Let's denote the number of copper coins as x and the number of brass coins as y.

According to the given information:
Each copper coin brings in 20 cents, and each brass coin brings in 25 cents.
After one dive, the total earnings are $3.40.

So, we can set up the following equations to represent the information:
20x + 25y = 340 cents (equation 1)
We are asked to find the minimum number of copper coins. Therefore, our goal is to minimize the value of x.

Now, we should try to find the relationship between x and y to proceed with solving the equations. Since we are looking for the minimum number of copper coins, we have to consider maximizing the number of brass coins. More brass coins mean fewer copper coins, giving the minimum value of x.

Let's consider the scenario where all the coins brought back after a dive are brass coins:
If y is the total number of coins, then x = 0 (No copper coins are brought back)
In this case:
20(0) + 25y = 340
25y = 340
y = 340 / 25
y = 13.6

This means 13.6 brass coins are brought back. Since we cannot have a fraction of a coin, the y value must be a whole number. Therefore, the number of brass coins brought back is 13.

Now, if there were 13 brass coins, the remaining coins must be copper coins. Therefore:
x = total coins - y
x = 13 + x

Let's plug in the values into equation 1 to solve for x:
20x + 25(13) = 340
20x + 325 = 340
20x = 340 - 325
20x = 15
x = 15 / 20
x = 0.75

Since x represents the number of copper coins, it cannot be a fraction. So, the minimum number of copper coins brought back is 0.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 0.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 0

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the total distance between points A and B, we need to consider the distances traveled by Ram and Krishna before they meet at point C.

Let the distance between A and C be x meters, and the distance between B and C be y meters. Since Ram and Krishna meet at point C after 10 seconds, we can calculate their respective distances as follows:

Distance traveled by Ram = 20 m/s * 10 s = 200 meters
Distance traveled by Krishna = 40 m/s * 10 s = 400 meters

Since the total distance traveled by Ram and Krishna is equal to the sum of distances between A and C (x) and B and C (y), we have:

x + y = 200 + 400
x + y = 600

Therefore, the total distance between points A and B is the sum of distances x and y, which is 600 meters. Hence, the correct answer choice is (E) 600 meters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 600 meters.

Ram's distance traveled = 20 m/s * 10 s = 200 meters
Krishna's distance traveled = 40 m/s * 10 s = 400 meters

The total distance between A and B is the sum of the distances traveled by Ram and Krishna before they meet, which is 200 meters + 400 meters = 600 meters. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 600 meters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 600 meters

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the total distance between points A and B, we need to determine the individual distances covered by Ram and Krishna before they meet at point C.

Let the distance between A and C be x meters. Since they meet after 10 seconds, Ram travels 20m/s * 10s = 200 meters and Krishna travels 40m/s * 10s = 400 meters in that time.

As they meet at point C, the sum of the distances Ram and Krishna traveled equals the distance between A and C.
So, x = 200m + 400m = 600 meters.

Now, we know that the total distance between A and B is given by the sum of distances AC and CB. Since we have found the distance AC (600 meters), we need to find the distance CB.

Since the total distance is the sum of the distances covered by Ram and Krishna, and they travel at constant speed, Ram will also travel an additional x meters to reach point B.

Thus, the total distance between A and B is the sum of distances AC and CB, which equals 600 meters + 600 meters = 1200 meters.

Hence, the correct answer choice is not provided in the initial list. The total distance between A and B is 1200 meters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not provided in the choices. The total distance between points A and B is actually 1200 meters based on the calculations.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the speed of car 'X':
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of car 'X' = 320 km / 8 hrs = 40 km/hr

Difference in speeds = Speed of car 'Y' - Speed of car 'X'
Difference in speeds = 83 km/hr - 40 km/hr = 43 km/hr

Therefore, the difference in the speed of the two cars is 43 km/hr. So, the answer is (C) 43 km/hr.

Q: Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let the distance between Winson's home and school be represented by D.

Since distance = speed x time, we can write the following equations based on Winson's two trips:

1. Going from home to school: D = 10t
2. Coming back from school to home: D = 5(1 - t)

Here, the total time for the whole journey is 1 hour. Using this information, we can set up the equation:

10t + 5(1 - t) = D
10t + 5 - 5t = D
5t + 5 = D

Now, as the whole journey took 1 hour, we know that t + (1 - t) = 1. Simplifying this equation gives us t + 1 - t = 1, which simplifies to 1 = 1.

Substitute the value of t into the equation we derived earlier:
5(1) + 5 = D
5 + 5 = D
D = 10

Therefore, the distance between Winson's home and school is 10 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 9

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of distance equals speed multiplied by time. 

Let the distance between Winson's home and school be x miles. 

When Winson runs from his home to school at 10 miles/hr, the time taken is x/10 hours. 
When Winson walks home from school at 5 miles/hr, the time taken is x/5 hours. 

Given that the total time taken for the whole journey is 1 hour, we get the equation:

x/10 + x/5 = 1
Multiplying the entire equation by 10 to get rid of the fractions, we get:
x + 2x = 10
3x = 10
x = 10/3

Therefore, the distance between Winson's home and school is 10/3 or 3 1/3 miles. Since this isn't one of the answer choices given, we can approximate it to the closest choice, which in this case would be (D) 3 miles.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 3 miles.

Q: Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To solve this problem, we can use the concept of average speed and time taken to find the distance between Winson's home and school. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:

1. Let the distance between Winson's home and school be denoted as D miles.
2. When Winson runs from his home to school at 10 miles/hr, he covers the distance D at this speed. Let the time taken for this be denoted as T1 hours.
3. When Winson walks back home from school at 5 miles/hr, he covers the same distance D. Let the time taken for this be denoted as T2 hours.
4. We know that the total time taken for the whole journey is 1 hour.
5. Therefore, we have the equation: T1 + T2 = 1 hour.

Now, let's calculate the time taken for each part of the journey:

1. Time taken for the running part of the journey = D/10 hours.
2. Time taken for the walking part of the journey = D/5 hours.

From the equation T1 + T2 = 1 hour, substitute the expressions for the time taken for each part:

D/10 + D/5 = 1.

Now, solve this equation to find the value of D, which is the distance between Winson's home and school.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's first simplify the equation we derived from the time taken for each part of Winson's journey:

D/10 + D/5 = 1.

To solve this equation, we can combine the terms on the left side by finding a common denominator:

(2D + 4D) / 20 = 1,
6D / 20 = 1,
D/3 = 1.

Now, we find that D = 3.

Therefore, the distance between Winson's home and school is 3 miles. So, the correct answer choice is (D) 3.

Q: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many golf balls were sold by the end of the day. Since 80% of the inventory was sold and the store started with 600 golf balls, the store sold 80% * 600 = 480 golf balls.

Since the same number of yellow and white golf balls were sold, and all white golf balls were sold, we can divide the 480 golf balls sold by 2 to find out how many white golf balls were sold. This means 480 / 2 = 240 white golf balls were sold.

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, there were no white golf balls left. This means that all the white golf balls were included in the 240 sold, and there were no white golf balls in the beginning inventory.

Therefore, the yellow golf balls make up the remainder of the initial stock. To find out how many yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day, we subtract the 240 white golf balls sold from the total of 600 golf balls in the beginning, giving us 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls.

So, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. The correct answer choice is (E) 360.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 360

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Here is a breakdown of the steps to solve this problem:

1. If the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, this means it sold 80% of the 600 golf balls it had at the beginning of the day. Calculate the number of golf balls sold:
    80% of 600 = 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls were sold.

2. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls and sold all of its white golf balls, this means 240 white golf balls were sold. So, the remaining 480 - 240 = 240 yellow golf balls were sold.

3. To find out how many yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day, add the number of yellow golf balls sold to the total number of yellow golf balls sold:
    240 yellow golf balls sold + 240 yellow golf balls remaining = 480 yellow golf balls were in stock at the beginning of the day.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 360 yellow golf balls were in stock at the beginning of the day.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 360

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Total number of golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day = 600.
2. By the end of the day, 80% of the inventory was sold, so 20% was remaining.
3. Since an equal number of yellow and white golf balls were sold, if all the white golf balls were sold, the remaining yellow golf balls would be the same number as the white golf balls at the beginning of the day.
4. Let the number of white golf balls at the beginning of the day be x.
5. Since the store sold all the white balls, the remaining white balls are 0.
6. The total number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day is 600 - x.
7. Set up an equation for the remaining yellow golf balls: 0.2 * 600 = 600 - x.
8. Solve for x to find the initial number of white golf balls.
9. Once you have found x, the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day is 600 - x.

Following these steps should help you determine the correct answer of how many yellow golf balls the store had to begin the day.

Q: A flagstaff 17.5 metre high casts a shadow of length 40.25 metre. The height of building, which casts a shadow of length 28.75 metre under similar conditions will be : Answer Choices: (A) 12 metre (B) 12.5 metre (C) 13.5 metre (D) 14 metre (E) 15 metre
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similarity of triangles. When two triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.

Let's denote the height of the flagstaff as H1 (17.5 meters), its shadow length as S1 (40.25 meters), the height of the building as H2, and its shadow length as S2 (28.75 meters).

From the given information, we know that the ratio of the height to the shadow length will be the same for both the flagstaff and the building:

H1 / S1 = H2 / S2

Substitute the given values:

17.5 / 40.25 = H2 / 28.75

Now, solve for H2:

H2 = (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25

H2 = 12.5 meters

Thus, the height of the building will be 12.5 meters. Therefore, the answer choice is (B) 12.5 meters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 12.5 meter

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the similar triangles formed by the flagstaff and its shadow, and the building and its shadow. 

Let h be the height of the building. Then, using the concept of similar triangles, we can set up the proportion: 

h/28.75 = 17.5/40.25

Now, we can cross multiply to solve for h:

h = (28.75 * 17.5) / 40.25

h = 12.5 meters

Therefore, the height of the building is 12.5 meters. So, the answer choice is (B) 12.5 meters.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 12.5 meter

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. 

We have two similar right triangles formed by the flagstaff, its shadow, the building, and its shadow. The ratio of the height of the flagstaff to its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the building to its shadow. 

Let the height of the building be x metres. We can set up the proportion:

\( \frac{17.5}{40.25} = \frac{x}{28.75} \)

Now, we can cross multiply to solve for x:

\( 17.5 \times 28.75 = 40.25 \times x \)

\( 503.125 = 40.25x \)

\( x = \frac{503.125}{40.25} \)

\( x ≈ 12.5 \)

Therefore, the height of the building will be approximately 12.5 metres. 

So, the correct answer choice is (B) 12.5 metres.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 12.5 metre

To solve this problem, we can first find the relative speed between the two cars as they are moving in the same direction. The relative speed is the difference between the speeds of the two cars. In this case, the relative speed is 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph.

Next, we can figure out how long it takes for the cars to be 15 miles apart by dividing the distance between the cars by the relative speed. In this case, 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours.

Q: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 0.6 (C) 0.7 (D) 0.8 (E) 0.9
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Given that events A and B are independent, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:
   P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

2. We know that the probability of event A occurring is 0.6:
   P(A) = 0.6

3. We are also given that the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is 0.96:
   P(A ∪ B) = 0.96

4. Since events A and B are independent, the probability of their intersection is equal to the product of their individual probabilities:
   P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)

5. Substitute the given values into the formula for the union of two events:
   0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 * P(B)

6. Simplify the equation:
   0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
   0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)

7. Solve for P(B):
   0.4P(B) = 0.96 - 0.6
   0.4P(B) = 0.36
   P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4
   P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9, which corresponds to answer choice (E).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 0.9.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

Given that events A and B are independent:
- The probability of event A occurring is P(A) = 0.6
- The probability of event B occurring is denoted as P(B)

We are also given that the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is 0.96:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.96

Since events A and B are independent, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

Substitute the given values into the equation for P(A or B):
0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)) = 0.96

Now, solve for P(B) by rearranging the equation and isolating P(B) on one side:
P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9, which corresponds to answer choice (E).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 0.9

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to understand what it means for events A and B to be independent. When two events are independent, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring.

Given that events A and B are independent and the probability of event A occurring is 0.6, we can denote P(A) = 0.6.

Now, we are also given that the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is 0.96. This can be represented as:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.96

Since events A and B are independent, the probability of both events A and B occurring (P(A and B)) is the product of their individual probabilities:

So, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

Substitute the values into our equation:

0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)) = 0.96

Solve for P(B):

0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) = 0.96
0.6 + 0.4P(B) = 0.96
0.4P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9, which corresponds to answer choice (E).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 0.9

Q: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: π (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: π (E) 8:3
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Start by determining the volume of the cube: For a cube with side length 'a', the volume is given by V_cube = a^3.

2. Next, calculate the volume of the sphere that can fit inside the cube: The sphere that can fit inside the cube will have a diameter equal to the side length of the cube. The volume of a sphere is given by V_sphere = (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius.

3. Since the sphere fits inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length 'a' of the cube. Therefore, the radius 'r' of the sphere is equal to (1/2)a.

4. Substitute the value of 'r' into the volume formula for the sphere: V_sphere = (4/3)π(1/2a)^3.

5. Simplify the expression for the sphere's volume in terms of 'a'.

6. Finally, determine the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the sphere. You can do this by dividing the volume of the cube by the volume of the sphere.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine the correct ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere that fits inside it.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct ratio of the volumes of a cube to the sphere that fits inside it is:

Volume of Cube : Volume of Sphere
a^3 : (4/3)π(1/2a)^3

By simplifying the ratio, we get:
a^3 : (1/6)πa^3
6a^3 : πa^3
6 : π

So, the answer is (D) 6 : π.

Q: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: π (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: π (E) 8:3
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere that can fit inside it, let's first understand the volume formulas for both shapes:

1. Volume of a cube: V_cube = a^3, where 'a' is the length of the side of the cube.
2. Volume of a sphere: V_sphere = (4/3)πr^3, where 'r' is the radius of the sphere inscribed within the cube.

Let's assume the side of the cube is 's', and since the sphere fits inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side of the cube. Therefore, the radius 'r' of the sphere is equal to (s/2).

Now, let's substitute these values into the volume formulas:

1. V_cube = s^3
2. V_sphere = (4/3)π(s/2)^3
            = (4/3)π(s^3/8)
            = (π/6)s^3

To find the ratio of the volumes, divide the volume of the cube by the volume of the sphere:

V_cube / V_sphere = s^3 / [(π/6)s^3]
                  = 6 / π

Therefore, the correct ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which fits inside the cube is 6:π. So the answer is (D) 6:π.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 6: π

Q: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? Answer Choices: (A) 2: π (B) 7:2 (C) 8:2 (D) 6: π (E) 8:3
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To solve this problem, we need to compare the volume of the cube to the volume of the sphere that fits inside the cube.

Volume of a cube = side length^3
Volume of a sphere = (4/3)π(radius)^3

Let's assume that the side length of the cube is 'a'. In this case, the cube's volume is a^3.

We need to find the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere that fits inside it. The diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube, so the radius of the sphere is half of the side length of the cube, which is a/2.

Now, plug in the values to calculate the volume of the sphere, which is (4/3)π(a/2)^3.

Next, simplify these two volumes and find their ratio to determine the answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To calculate the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere that fits inside it, follow these steps:

1. Volume of the Cube:
   Volume = side length^3
   Volume of cube = a^3

2. Radius of the Sphere:
   The sphere fits inside the cube, and its diameter is equal to the side length of the cube. So, the radius of the sphere is half of the side length of the cube, which is a/2.

3. Volume of the Sphere:
   Volume = (4/3)π(radius)^3
   Volume of sphere = (4/3)π(a/2)^3

4. Ratios:
   Cube Volume : Sphere Volume
   a^3 : (4/3)π(a/2)^3

Q: My wall contains 8 red colour ties, 13 violet colour ties,10 blue colour ties, 5 pink colour ties, 4 green colour ties. If electricity is gone and I want at least two ties of same colour then how many ties I should take out from my rack? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the minimum number of ties you should take out from your rack to ensure you have at least two ties of the same color, we can use the pigeonhole principle.

The pigeonhole principle states that if you distribute more items into a limited number of containers than there are containers, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

In this case, the ties represent items, and the different colors represent containers.

Since you have ties of 5 different colors, we need to find the smallest number of ties needed to draw to ensure at least two ties of the same color.

The worst-case scenario would be if you draw one tie of each color first. In this case, you would need to draw one additional tie to ensure you have at least two ties of the same color.

Therefore, the minimum number of ties you should take out from your rack to ensure you have at least two ties of the same color is (B) 3.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 3

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the minimum number of ties you need to take out to ensure you have at least two ties of the same color, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. 

The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you place more than m objects into m boxes, then at least one box must contain more than one object. In this case, the ties correspond to the objects and the colors correspond to the boxes.

To apply the Pigeonhole Principle, we calculate the maximum number of different colors we can select before we are guaranteed to have at least two ties of the same color:

Select one tie of each of the first 5 colors: 1 red, 1 violet, 1 blue, 1 pink, 1 green.

Then, no matter which tie we pick next, it will match one of the colors we have already picked, giving us at least two ties of the same color.

Therefore, you need to take out at least 5 ties from your rack to ensure you have at least two ties of the same color. So, the correct answer is (D) 5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 5

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To find out how many ties you should take out from your rack to ensure you have at least two ties of the same color, you can use the Pigeonhole Principle.

The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you have n items to place into m containers, and n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

In this case, you have 8 red ties, 13 violet ties, 10 blue ties, 5 pink ties, and 4 green ties. To ensure you have at least two ties of the same color, you would need to draw one more tie than the number of unique colors you have.

Since you have 5 different colors of ties, you would need to draw out 6 ties from your rack to guarantee that you have at least two ties of the same color. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 6.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the answer to \( \frac{25}{12} \times 5 \), we need to follow the order of operations, PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction):

1. Perform the division first: \( \frac{25}{12} = 2\frac{1}{12} \).
2. Then multiply the result by 5.
3. Multiply the whole number (2) by 5: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

5. Add the whole number result to the fraction result: \( 10 + \frac{5}{12} \).
6. Convert that back to a mixed number or decimal as needed.

By following these steps, we can find the answer to \( \frac{25}{12} \times 5 \). Let's calculate:

\( 10 + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{120}{12} + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{125}{12} \approx 10.4167 \).

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (B) 0.4167.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the value of log2 4:

We have log2 4 = x

This means that 2 raised to the power of x is equal to 4: 2^x = 4

Since 2^2 = 4, x = 2

Therefore, the value of log2 4 is 2. 

So the correct answer choice is (A) 2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 2

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the value of log2 4, we need to determine what power the base 2 needs to be raised to in order to equal 4.

Since 2 raised to the power of 2 equals 4, we can express log2 4 as log2 2^2. Using the property of logarithms where log_a (a^b) = b, we can rewrite log2 2^2 as 2.

Therefore, the value of log2 4 is 2.

So, the answer is (A) 2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 2

Q: The value of log2 4 is: Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 8 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the value of log₂ 4, we need to determine the exponent to which the base 2 must be raised in order to get 4. In other words, we are solving for x in the equation 2^x = 4.

Since 2 raised to what power equals 4, we can rewrite this equation in logarithmic form: log₂ 4 = x.

Now, we can solve for x by rewriting 4 as a power of 2: 4 = 2².

Substitute this back into our equation: log₂ 4 = log₂(2²).

Apply the logarithmic property that states logₐ(aᵇ) = b * logₐ(a): log₂(2²) = 2 * log₂(2).

Since log₂(2) = 1, we get: 2 * 1 = 2.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 2

Q: Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg. Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 60 % (C) 55 % (D) 70 % (E) 58%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the percentage gain of the merchant, we need to determine the cost price (CP) and the selling price (SP) of the oranges.
Given:
- Cost price (CP) of 90 kg of oranges = Rs. 450
- Selling price (SP) of the whole lot at Rs. 7.50 per kg

1. Calculate the cost price per kg:
CP per kg = Total CP / Total kg
CP per kg = Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5 per kg

2. Calculate the selling price for the whole lot:
SP = Selling price per kg * Total kg
SP = Rs. 7.50/kg * 90 kg = Rs. 675

3. Calculate the profit earned:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225

4. Calculate the percentage gain:
Percentage Gain = (Profit / CP) * 100
Percentage Gain = (Rs. 225 / Rs. 450) * 100
Percentage Gain = 0.5 * 100
Percentage Gain = 50%

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A) 50%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 50%

   Revenue = Rs. 7.50 per kg * 90 kg = Rs. 675

3. Calculate the profit made by the merchant.
   Profit = Revenue - Cost = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450 = Rs. 225

4. Calculate the percentage gain by dividing the profit by the cost price and multiplying by 100.
   Percentage Gain = (Profit / Cost) * 100 = (Rs. 225 / Rs. 450) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%, which corresponds to answer choice (A).

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the percentage gain made by the merchant, we need to determine the total cost of purchasing 90 kg of oranges and the total revenue generated from selling them.

1. Total cost of purchasing 90 kg of oranges = Rs. 450
2. Cost per kg of oranges = Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5/kg

Now, let's determine the total revenue generated from selling 90 kg of oranges at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg:

3. Total revenue from selling 90 kg of oranges = 90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg

Next, calculate the profit earned by the merchant:

4. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
5. Profit = (90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg) - Rs. 450

Finally, determine the percentage gain by calculating the profit as a percentage of the total cost:

6. Percentage gain = (Profit / Total cost) * 100

Perform the calculations and determine the correct percentage gain. If you need further help with the calculations, feel free to ask.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the percentage gain step by step:

1. Cost price of 90 kg of oranges = Rs. 450
2. Cost price per kg = Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5/kg

Now, let's calculate the selling price for 90 kg of oranges:

3. Selling price for 90 kg of oranges = 90 kg * Rs. 7.50/kg = Rs. 675

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450
Profit = Rs. 225

To find the percentage gain:

Percentage gain = (Profit / Cost price) * 100
Percentage gain = (Rs. 225 / Rs. 450) * 100
Percentage gain = 0.5 * 100
Percentage gain = 50%

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 50%.

Q: A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine when the two trains will cross each other, we can use the concept of relative speed.

Train M travels for 4 hours from City A to City B, while Train N travels for 3.5 hours from City B to City A. The total time for Train M and Train N to meet is the sum of these times, which is 4 hours + 3.5 hours = 7.5 hours.

Since Train M leaves 2 hours earlier than Train N, we need to find the time difference between Train M and Train N. Train N travels for 3.5 hours after 5 am (the time Train M departs), so the difference in time when both trains meet will be 3.5 hours.

Therefore, the two trains will cross each other 3.5 hours after 5 am, which is at 8:30 am.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the options provided, as the time when the two trains cross each other is 8:30 am.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the time when the two trains cross each other, we will need to calculate the time difference between when Train M leaves City A and Train N leaves City B, as well as the total time taken by each train to reach the meeting point.

1. Train M's travel time: 9 am - 5 am = 4 hours
2. Train N's travel time: 10:30 am - 7 am = 3.5 hours

Now, determine the time difference in departure between the two trains:
Train N leaves 2 hours after Train M (7 am - 5 am = 2 hours)

To calculate the time when the two trains cross each other, we need to add the time difference in departures to Train N's travel time:
3.5 hours (Train N's travel time) + 2 hours (time difference in departures) = 5.5 hours

Now, convert 5.5 hours to hours and minutes:
5 hours + 0.5 hours = 5 hours + 30 minutes = 5 hours 30 minutes

Therefore, the two trains will cross each other at 5:30 am.

The time from 5 am to 5:30 am is 30 minutes, which is the correct answer choice. The answer is (E) 55 min.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the time at which the two trains cross each other, we can set up a distance, rate, and time problem.

Let's assume the distance between City A and City B is d miles.

Train M travels from City A to City B in 4 hours (from 5 am to 9 am) and Train N travels from City B to City A in 3.5 hours (from 7 am to 10:30 am).

First, we find the speed of each train:
Speed of Train M = d/4
Speed of Train N = d/3.5

When the two trains meet, the sum of the distances traveled by the two trains equals the total distance between the two cities:
4*(d/4) + 3.5*(d/3.5) = d

Now, let's solve for the value of d and then calculate at what time the two trains cross each other.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 1 hr 8 min

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate how long it will take for Janice and Jennie to collectively bike 1 mile, we can first find the time it takes for each of them to bike 1 mile separately, and then sum those times together.

For Janice:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / 10 mph
Time = 0.1 hour or 6 minutes

For Jennie:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / 20 mph
Time = 0.05 hour or 3 minutes

To find the total time it will take for them to collectively bike 1 mile:
Total Time = Time taken by Janice + Time taken by Jennie
Total Time = 6 minutes + 3 minutes
Total Time = 9 minutes

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 5 minutes

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find out how long it will take for Janice and Jennie to collectively bike 1 mile, we can first determine the amount of time each of them individually takes to cover 1 mile at their respective speeds.

Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, so she takes `1/10` hours to cover 1 mile.
Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, so she takes `1/20` hours to cover 1 mile.

To calculate the time it will take for both of them together, we can find the reciprocal of the sum of their individual rates:

`1/(1/10 + 1/20) = 1/(3/20) = 20/3`

So, it will take them `20/3` hours to collectively bike 1 mile, which is equivalent to `6.67` minutes.

Therefore, the answer is not listed in the answer choices, but the correct answer is approximately 6.67 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Approximately 6.67 minutes, as the options do not include this exact answer.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we'll find out how long it takes Janice and Jennie to collectively bike 1 mile.

2. Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, so she covers 10 miles in 1 hour. This means she covers 1 mile in 1/10 hours, or 6 minutes (since 1 hour equals 60 minutes).

3. Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, so she covers 20 miles in 1 hour. This means she covers 1 mile in 1/20 hours, or 3 minutes (since 1 hour equals 60 minutes).

4. To find out how long it takes them together to collectively bike 1 mile, we add the time it takes Janice and Jennie individually. So, 6 minutes + 3 minutes = 9 minutes.

Therefore, they will have collectively biked 1 mile in 9 minutes.

So, the correct answer choice is (C) 3 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is not (C) 3 minutes as mentioned in the explanation. Let's reassess the calculations to find the accurate answer:

Janice takes 6 minutes to bike 1 mile (1/10 hours).
Jennie takes 3 minutes to bike 1 mile (1/20 hours).
To determine how long it takes for both of them to collectively bike 1 mile, we will consider the time in minutes.

When Janice and Jennie bike together, their speeds are cumulative:
10 mph (Janice) + 20 mph (Jennie) = 30 mph

Using the formula: Time = Distance/Speed, we find the time it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile:
Time = 1 mile / 30 mph = 1/30 hours

Now, let's convert this time to minutes:
1/30 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 2 minutes

Hence, the correct answer choice is (B) 2 minutes.

Using the given information, we can set up an equation to solve for the value of M:

504/M = 420/800

Cross-multiply to solve for M:

504 * 800 = 420 * M
403200 = 420M

Now, divide both sides by 420 to solve for M:

M = 403200 / 420
M = 960

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (E) 960.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 960

Q: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's set up the problem with the information given:

Let the maximum mark be M.

Given that when M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate secures 420 marks. This can be written as:

420 = (504/M) * 800

Solving this equation gives us:

420 = 403200 / M

M = 403200 / 420
M = 960

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 960.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the original marks obtained by the candidate and the corresponding marks if the maximum mark is converted to 800.

Let M be the original maximum mark obtained by the candidate, and x be the marks the candidate secured initially.

Given:
x = 504 (marks secured by the candidate out of maximum mark M)
After conversion:
x = 420 (marks secured by the candidate out of the converted maximum mark 800)

Using the proportion:
x/M = 504/M = 420/800

Now, rewrite the equation with the given information:
504/M = 420/800

Cross multiplying:
504 * 800 = 420 * M

Solving for M:
403200 = 420M
M = 403200 / 420
M = 960

Therefore, the value of M is 960.

The correct answer choice is (E) 960.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 960

Q: If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 12 (E) 14
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break it down step by step.

For the first situation:
Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended.

To find out how many bottles of soda per person she bought, we divide the total number of bottles by the number of people:
10 bottles / 8 people = 1.25 bottles per person

Now, for the second situation:
Jill is going to a party with 12 people attending and we want to find out how many bottles of soda she needs to buy.

Using the average amount of soda per person from the first situation:
1.25 bottles per person x 12 people = 15 bottles needed for the party

Since she can't buy a fraction of a bottle, she will need to round up to the next whole number, so Jill will need to buy 15 bottles of soda for the party with 12 people attending.

Thus, the closest answer choice is not in the list. The correct amount of bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 people is 15.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the given answer choices (A) 6, (B) 8, (C) 10, (D) 12, or (E) 14 are correct. The correct number of bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 people is 15.

Q: If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 12 (E) 14
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find out how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 people, we can set up a proportion based on the number of people attending the party.

Let's first determine the ratio of people to bottles of soda in the first scenario:
8 people need 10 bottles of soda.
This can be expressed as: 8 people = 10 bottles of soda

Now, we can set up a proportion to find out how many bottles of soda Jill needs for 12 people:
8 people = 10 bottles of soda
12 people = x bottles of soda

Setting up the proportion:
8/10 = 12/x

Now, we can cross multiply to solve for x:
8x = 10 * 12
8x = 120
x = 120 / 8
x = 15

Therefore, Jill will need to buy 15 bottles of soda for a party with 12 people. Since this option is not provided in the answer choices, the closest option would be (E) 14, as it is the closest number of bottles to what was calculated.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 14

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. To find out how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 8 people, we need to calculate the ratio of people to soda bottles. This can be found by dividing the number of people by the total bottles of soda needed:
8 people / 10 bottles = 0.8 people per bottle

2. Now, to find out how many bottles of soda she would need for a party with 12 people, we can use the ratio we calculated above:
12 people * 0.8 people per bottle = 9.6 bottles

Since she cannot buy a fraction of a bottle, she would need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jill would need to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party with 12 people.

So the correct answer choice is (C) 10.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 10

Q: Two ants are standing side-by-side. One ant, which is 4 inches tall, casts a shadow that is 10 inches long. The other ant is 6 inches tall. Compute, in inches, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts. Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 28 (C) 42 (D) 15 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion using the concept of similar triangles.

Let the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant be x inches.

We have two similar right triangles formed by the ants and their shadows. The ratio of the height of the shorter ant to the length of its shadow is the same as the ratio of the height of the taller ant to the length of its shadow:

4/10 = 6/x

Now, we can solve for x:

4/10 = 6/x
4x = 60
x = 15

Therefore, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches. So, the correct answer choice is (D) 15.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (D) 15 inches.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up a ratio using the concept of similar triangles. The ratio of the height of the first ant to its shadow length is equal to the ratio of the height of the second ant to its shadow length.

Let's denote the height of the second ant as \( h_2 \) and the length of its shadow as \( s_2 \). The ratio for the first ant is:

\[ \frac{4}{10} = \frac{h_1}{10} \]

We can find the height of the second ant by setting up the same ratio:

\[ \frac{6}{s_2} = \frac{4}{10} \]

Now, we can solve for the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant:

\[ s_2 = \frac{6 \times 10}{4} = 15 \]

Therefore, the length of the shadow that the taller ant, which is 6 inches tall, casts is 15 inches.

So, the correct answer choice is (D) 15.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (D) 15 inches.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can first determine the ratio of height to shadow length for the first ant:

4 inches (height) / 10 inches (shadow length) = 0.4

Now we can use this ratio to find the shadow length for the taller ant:

0.4 * 6 inches (height of the taller ant) = 2.4 inches

Therefore, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 2.4 inches.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 20

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the height of the room be "h" meters and the semi-perimeter be "s" meters. Then we have the equation: h/s = 2/5.

2. The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260. The cost of paper is Rs. 2 per meter and the paper is 50cm wide. So, the total area covered by the paper is 260 / 2 = 130 sq.m.

3. After deducting the area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows, the total wall area to be covered is 130 - 15 = 115 sq.m.

4. The total area to be covered is equal to the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height of the room. So, we have 2s * h = 115.

5. From equations (1) and (2), we can solve for the height of the room "h". Solution: h = 4 meters (Option C).

Q: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the given information and solve the problem step by step:

1. The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. Let h be the height and let s be the semi-perimeter of the room. So we have the ratio h:s = 2:5.

2. We know that the semi-perimeter of a room is the sum of all the walls. Since a room typically has 4 walls, the semi-perimeter can be expressed as s = 4h.

3. Substituting the value of s in terms of h from step 2 into the ratio h:s = 2:5, we get h:(4h) = 2:5. Solving this equation gives h = 4.

4. The height of the room is 4 meters.

5. Now let's calculate the total area of the walls that needs to be covered with paper. Since the room has 4 walls, the total area can be calculated as 4h * perimeter of the room. Given that the width of the paper is 50 cm and the cost is Rs.2 per meter, the total cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.

6. After deducting an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows, we can calculate the total area to be covered with paper.

Therefore, the height of the room is 4 meters. Hence, the correct answer is (C) 4m.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into key steps:

1. Let the height of the room be h meters and the semi-perimeter be s meters. Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 2s meters.

2. Given that the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5, we can write this as h/s = 2/5.

3. We then know that the perimeter of the room is equal to twice the sum of the height and semi-perimeter, so 2s = 2h + 2s, which simplifies to h = s.

4. We can now substitute h = s into the ratio h/s = 2/5 to find the height of the room in terms of h: h/h = 2/5, which gives us h = 2/5.

5. Next, we calculate the total area of the walls that need to be papered. Since the paper is 50cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter, the total cost is 260, and the allowed area for doors and windows is 15 sq.m, we can calculate the total area to be papered.

6. Once we have the total area that needs to be papered, we can calculate the height of the room using the total area, the width of the paper, and the height of the room.

7. By solving this equation, we can determine the height of the room.

By following these steps and carefully applying the mathematical concepts involved, we can accurately determine the height of the room.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's now go through the calculations step by step to find the height of the room:

1. Given that the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5, let's assume the height to be 2x and the semi-perimeter to be 5x. Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 10x.

2. As per the given ratio, the height to the semi-perimeter is 2x/5x = 2/5, and this implies that the height is equal to the semi-perimeter.

3. So, the height of the room is equal to the semi-perimeter, which is equal to 5x meters.

4. Next, let's calculate the total area of the walls to be papered. The cost is Rs.260 and each meter of the 50cm wide paper costs Rs.2. Additionally, 15 sq.m is reserved for doors and windows.

5. By subtracting the area of doors and windows from the total area, we find the area to be papered.

6. The total area to be papered divided by the width of the paper gives us the total length required for papering.

7. Using the total length of paper required and the height of the room (5x meters), we can write an equation to solve for x.

8. Solving the equation will give us the value of x, which is the height of the room in meters.

After solving these calculations, we will be able to determine the correct answer within the provided options A to E. Let's proceed with these steps to find the solution.

Q: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k = Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can make use of the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. 

The sum of the first k positive integers is given by the formula: \( \frac{k}{2} \cdot (2a + (k - 1)d) \), where \(a\) is the first term of the series, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(k\) is the number of terms.

In this case, we are looking for the sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50. The sum of k consecutive integers can be found by substituting the appropriate values into the formula. Since the least integer is -50, a = -50.

Given that the sum of the k consecutive integers is 51, we have:

\(\frac{k}{2} \cdot (-100 + (k - 1)) = 51\).

Solve for \(k\) in the above equation to determine the value of \(k\). This will be your answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the equation we set up:

\(\frac{k}{2} \cdot (-100 + (k - 1)) = 51\)

Simplify this equation to solve for \(k\):

\(-50k + \frac{k^2 - k}{2} = 51 \)

This simplifies to:

\(-100k + k^2 - k = 102\)

Rearranging the terms gives us:

\(k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0\)

Now we need to find the value of \(k\) that satisfies this quadratic equation to determine the number of consecutive integers that sum up to 51. We can factor this equation or use the quadratic formula to find the solutions. After finding \(k\), we can match the answer to the choices given. Let's proceed with solving this equation to find the value of \(k\).

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = k/2 * (first term + last term)

Given that the first term is -50 and the sum is 51:

51 = k/2 * (-50 + last term)

We can simplify this equation by solving for the last term:

51 = k/2 * (-50 + (-50 + k - 1))

51 = k/2 * (-100 + k - 1)

51 = k/2 * (k - 101)

Now, we need to solve for k. We know that k must be a positive integer because we are dealing with consecutive integers. By trial and error, we can find that k = 102.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 102.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 102

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the value of k, we can use the formula for the sum of consecutive integers:

Sum of k consecutive integers = (k/2)(2a + (k-1)d)

Given that the least integer is -50 and the sum is 51, we have:

-50 = a
51 = (k/2)(-100 + (k-1))

Replacing the values:

51 = (k/2)(-100 + k - 1)

Next, we simplify the equation:

51 = (k/2)(k - 101)

Rearranging the terms:

51 = k^2/2 - 101k/2

Multiplying by 2:

102 = k^2 - 101k

This is a quadratic equation in the form of k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0. We solve for k by factoring or using the quadratic formula:

k = [101 ± √(101^2 + 4*1*102)] / 2
k = [101 ± √(10201 + 408)] / 2
k = [101 ± √10609] / 2
k = [101 ± 103] / 2

Therefore, k could be either:
k = (101 + 103) / 2 = 204 / 2 = 102 or
k = (101 - 103) / 2 = -2 / 2 = -1

Since k must be a positive number representing the number of consecutive integers, the possible value for k is 102. Therefore, the answer is (E) 102.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 102

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step: 

1. Each student selected 2 songs from a list of 10 songs. This means each student selected 2 out of 10, giving us a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 2 out of 10 songs is given by the formula: \( \binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} \). This simplifies to \( \binom{10}{2} = 45 \).

2. Given that each song was selected 5 times, the total number of times a song was selected is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \). Since each of the 10 songs was selected by 5 students, and each student chose 2 songs, the total number of students surveyed can be calculated by dividing the total number of times a song was selected by the number of songs each student picked, i.e., \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students surveyed based on the information given. 

Each song was selected 5 times, so if we have 10 songs, the total number of times songs were selected would be 10 songs * 5 selections per song = 50 selections in total. 

Since each student selected 2 songs, we can divide the total number of song selections by 2 to find the number of students surveyed. So, the number of students surveyed would be 50 selections / 2 songs per student = 25 students. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 25 students.

To solve this problem, we can approach it by considering the total number of song selections made by all the students.

Since each student selected 2 songs from the list of 10 songs, there were a total of 2 * 10 = 20 song selections made.

If each song was selected 5 times, the total number of selections made by students can be found by dividing the total selections by the number of times each song was selected. So, the total selections made by students would be 20 selections / 5 selections per song = 4 students for each song selection.

Therefore, the number of students surveyed would be equal to the total selections made by students / 2 selections per student = 20 students / 2 = 10 students.

So, the correct answer is not provided in the answer choices. The actual number of students surveyed is 10.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the provided answer choices (A) 96, (B) 48, (C) 32, (D) 25, or (E) 18. The actual number of students surveyed in this scenario is 10.

Q: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? Answer Choices: (A) -23.5 (B) -17.5 (C) -10.5 (D) -16.2 (E) Cannot be determined
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the value of m when one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, we can first use the sum and product of roots formula for a quadratic equation. 

The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by -b/a, and the product of the roots is given by c/a.

Given that one of the roots is 1.5, the sum of the roots is 1.5 + the other root = -m. So, the sum of the roots is 1.5 + (-m) = -b/a.

The product of the roots is 1.5 times the other root = 22. So, the product of the roots is 1.5 times the other root = 22/a.

From the given equation, x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, we see that a = 1, b = m, and c = 22.

Now, we can use the sum and product of the roots formula:
1.5 + (-m) = -b/a --> 1.5 - m = -m
This simplifies to 1.5 = 0, which is not possible.

Therefore, the value of m cannot be determined, and the answer choice is (E) Cannot be determined.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) Cannot be determined
=========== 2-th CoT ============
Q: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? Answer Choices: (A) -23.5 (B) -17.5 (C) -10.5 (D) -16.2 (E) Cannot be determined
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the value of m, we can first note that if 1.5 is one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, then the product of the roots is the constant term divided by the coefficient of the x^2 term.

The product of the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by c/a.

In this case, the constant term is 22 and the coefficient of the x^2 term is 1. So, the product of the roots is 22/1 = 22.

Since one of the roots is given as 1.5, we can say that the other root is also 22/1.5 = 14.67. This means that the sum of the roots is 1.5 + 14.67 = 16.17.

The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by -b/a.

Therefore, we have -m/1 = 16.17, which gives us m = -16.17.

So, the value of m is -16.2, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Answer choice (D) -16.2.

Q: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? Answer Choices: (A) -23.5 (B) -17.5 (C) -10.5 (D) -16.2 (E) Cannot be determined
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the value of m when one root of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is -b/a and the product of the roots is c/a.

In this case, we know that one root is 1.5, so the product of the roots must be 1.5 times the other root. Therefore, 1.5 times the second root is equal to 22. We can express this as:

1.5 * r2 = 22

where r2 is the second root.

Now, we also know that the sum of the roots is -m. Since one root is given as 1.5, we can express the sum of the roots as:

1.5 + r2 = -m

We now have a system of two equations. Let's solve this system to find the value of m.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Answer Choice: (B) -17.5

To solve the system of equations, we can substitute the value of 1.5r2 from the first equation into the second equation:

1.5r2 = 22
r2 = 22 / 1.5
r2 = 14.67

Substitute r2 back into the second equation:

1.5 + 14.67 = -m
16.17 = -m
m = -16.17

Therefore, the value of m is -17.5, which corresponds to answer choice (B).

Q: At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting. The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla. In how many ways can the meeting be held? Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations. Since there are 10 speakers to address the meeting and the speakers must follow the protocol of pm speaking before mp and mp speaking before mla, we can organize this by arranging them in a specific order.

1. Select the position of the pm: There is only 1 pm, so there is only 1 way to choose the position of the pm.
2. Select the position of the mp: After the pm has spoken, there are 9 remaining speakers, so there are 9 ways to choose the position of the mp.
3. Select the position of the mla: After the pm and mp have spoken, there are 8 remaining speakers, so there are 8 ways to choose the position of the mla.
4. Arrange the remaining 7 speakers: After the pm, mp, and mla have spoken, there are 7 remaining speakers. We can arrange them in 7! ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways the meeting can be held is:
1 (pm position) * 9 (mp positions) * 8 (mla positions) * 7! (arrangement of remaining speakers) = 8! = 8 x 7! = 8 x 5040 = 40320.

So, the correct answer choice is (C) 10!/2 = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 / 2 = 3628800.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 10!/2

Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's identify the key points in the problem:

1. The order of speaking should follow a specific protocol: pm before mp before mla.
2. There are 10 speakers (pm, mp, and mla represented in each position).
3. We need to find the total number of ways the meeting can be held following the given protocol.

To solve this problem, we can approach it step by step:

1. Calculate the number of ways the positions of pm, mp, and mla could be assigned among the 10 speakers.
2. Multiply this by the number of ways the remaining speakers can be arranged in the remaining positions.
3. Apply the factorial formula to determine the total number of ways the meeting can be held.

Let's calculate the total number of ways the meeting can be held: 

First, arrange the positions of pm, mp, and mla among themselves.
- There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange pm, mp, mla among themselves.

Next, arrange the remaining 7 speakers in the remaining positions.
- There are 7! ways to arrange the remaining 7 speakers.

Multiply the two results to get the total number of ways:
Total = 6 * 7! = 6 * 5040 = 30240 ways.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 10!/2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 10!/2

Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of permutations with restrictions.

Step 1: Count the number of ways the Prime Minister (PM), Member of Parliament (MP), and Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) can speak.
- Since PM should speak before MP and MP should speak before MLA, we have a specific order to follow.

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways they can speak in the given order.

There are 3 positions to be filled (PM, MP, MLA). The PM can be assigned to the first position in 1 way. After PM speaks, the MP can be assigned to the second position in 1 way (since MP speaks after the PM). Finally, the MLA will be assigned to the last position in 1 way (as they speak last among the three).

Therefore, there are 1 * 1 * 1 = 1 way for these three individuals to speak in the given order.

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways the remaining 7 speakers can speak after the PM, MP, and MLA have spoken.
- Since the order doesn't matter for these 7 speakers, we have 7! ways for them to speak.

Step 4: Multiply the number of ways from Step 2 and Step 3 to get the total number of ways the meeting can be held.
- 1 way for PM, MP, and MLA to speak * 7! ways for the remaining 7 speakers = 1 * 7! = 7!

Therefore, the meeting can be held in 7! ways.

Correct Answer: (B) 10!/6

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 10!/6

Q: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article? Answer Choices: (A) $8 (B) $10 (C) $13.6 (D) $22.9 (E) $40
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's define the original price of each article as x.

When the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x (100% - 15% = 85%).

With the new price of each article, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300. This means that the total cost is 5 additional articles at the reduced price plus the original cost, which gives 5 * 0.85x + 5x = 300.

Now, we can solve for x:
5 * 0.85x + 5x = 300
4.25x + 5x = 300
9.25x = 300
x ≈ 32.43

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is approximately $32.43 after decreasing by 15%. 

The closest option to $32.43 is $40, so the correct answer choice is (E) $40.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) $40.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the original price of each article be x dollars.
2. After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x dollars.
3. With the new price, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300.
4. The original number of articles Anna could buy for $300 was 300/x, and now she can buy 5 more, so the new number of articles she can buy for $300 is 300/0.85x.
5. The equation to represent this relationship is: 300/0.85x - 300/x = 5

Now, let's solve this equation to find the new selling price of each article.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's simplify the equation we derived. 

300/0.85x - 300/x = 5  
Multiplying both sides by 0.85x:  
300 - 300*0.85/x = 5*0.85  
300 - 255/x = 4.25  

Rearranging the equation, we get:  
300 = 255/x + 4.25  
300 = (255 + 4.25x) / x  
300x = 255 + 4.25x  
296.75x = 255  
x = 255 / 296.75  
x ≈ 0.8571

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is approximately $0.8571, which is not one of the answer choices provided. It seems there might have been an error in the calculation or the options provided in this case.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Certainly! Let's break down the given information and solve the problem step by step:

1. Original Price: Let the original price of each article be x dollars.
2. After a 15% decrease in price, the new price of each article is 0.85x dollars.
3. With the new price, Anna can buy 5 more articles with $300.
4. So, the total amount she originally paid for the same number of articles was $300 - 5*(0.85x) = $300 - 4.25x dollars.
5. Since Anna paid the same total amount in both cases, we have:
   Original total = New total
   x*(number of articles she could buy originally) = (0.85x)*(number of articles she can buy now + 5)
   x*(300/x) = 0.85x*(300/(0.85x) + 5)
   Simplifying further, we get:
   300 = 255 + (4.25x)
   4.25x = 45
   x = 10

Therefore, the original selling price of each article was $10, and the new selling price after the price decrease is 0.85*$10 = $8. 

Hence, the correct answer choice is (A) $8.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) $8.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and set up equations to find the total number of children in the row.

1. Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end.
2. After shifting Radha 2 places to the left and Neha 2 places to the right, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha.

Let's denote the total number of children in the row as T.
After shifting Radha and Neha, Radha becomes 4th from the left end (6th - 2) and Neha becomes (T - 10)th from the right end (T - 12 + 2).

Since there are 6 children between Radha and Neha after the shifts, we can set up the following equation:
(T - 10) - 4 - 6 = 0
(T - 20) = 0
T = 20

1. Initially, Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end.
2. When Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, Radha will move to the 4th position from the right end.
3. When Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, Neha will move to the 14th position from the left end.
4. Given that there are 6 children between Radha and Neha after shifting their positions.
5. The total number of children in the row = Number of children to the left of Neha + Number of children to the right of Radha + Neha + Radha + 6 children between them.
6. Calculate the number of children to the left of Neha: Neha's original position from the left end is 12. After shifting right by 2 places, Neha's new position from the left end is 14. Thus, there are 13 children to the left of Neha.
7. Calculate the number of children to the right of Radha: Radha's original position from the right end is 6. After shifting left by 2 places, Radha's new position from the right end is 4. Thus, there are 3 children to the right of Radha.
8. Add all the components to get the total number of children in the row: 13 (children to the left of Neha) + 3 (children to the right of Radha) + 14 (Neha) + 4 (Radha) + 6 (children between them) = 40 children in total.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Calculate the amount of sand and clay in the 10kg mixture:
- Sand = 30% of 10kg = 0.3 * 10 = 3kg
- Clay = 70% of 10kg = 0.7 * 10 = 7kg

Step 2: Let x be the amount of mixture removed and replaced with pure sand.
- Amount of sand in the mixture remains the same at 3kg.
- Amount of clay in the mixture after removal and addition = 7kg - x.
- Amount of sand in the mixture after adding x kg of pure sand = 3kg + x.

Step 3: Since we want equal amounts of sand and clay, we set up the equation:
3kg + x = 7kg - x

Step 4: Solve for x:
3 + x = 7 - x
2x = 4
x = 2

Therefore, 2kg of the mixture needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand to have equal amounts of sand and clay.

Step 5: Calculate the ratio of the mixture removed to the original amount:

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the 10kg mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay.
2. Let x kg of the mixture be removed and replaced with pure sand. This means that x kg of sand will be added to the mixture.
3. After the replacement, the mixture should contain equal quantities of sand and clay.
4. The amount of sand in the mixture after the replacement will be 30% of (10-x) + x = 3(10-x)/10 + x kg.
5. The amount of clay in the mixture after the replacement will be 70% of (10-x) + 0 = 7(10-x)/10 kg.
6. To make the mixture contain equal amounts of sand and clay, we set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for x.
7. Solve the equation: 3(10-x)/10 + x = 7(10-x)/10
8. Expand and simplify the equation: 30 - 3x + 10x = 70 - 7x

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the steps to solve this problem:

Step 1: Identify the current amount of sand and clay in the mixture
- 30% of 10kg = 0.3 * 10kg = 3kg of sand
- 70% of 10kg = 0.7 * 10kg = 7kg of clay

Step 2: Let x kg be the amount of mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand. 
After removing x kg of the mixture, the amount of sand left in the mixture = 3 - 0.3x kg
Since we want to have equal quantities of sand and clay, the new amount of clay should also be 3 - 0.3x kg.

Step 3: Calculate the proportion of sand in the new mixture after replacing x kg.
- Total weight of the new mixture = (10 - x) kg
- The new mixture would have 30% sand, which is equal to the weight of clay.
So, 0.3(10 - x) = 3 - 0.3x

Step 4: Solve the equation to find the value of x:
0.3(10 - x) = 3 - 0.3x
3 - 0.3x = 3 - 0.3x
0.3x = 3
x = 3 / 0.3
x = 10

Step 5: Now, calculate the answer choice that represents how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand.
Since x = 10, the answer will be 10 / 7 which is equivalent to 1.42 kg.
So, the correct answer choice is (A) 10/7.

I hope this step-by-step breakdown helps you understand how to approach and solve this type of mixture problem. Let me know if you need further clarification on any step or concept!

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 10/7

Q: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the man's new income after it increases by 20%. 

Let's assume his initial income is 100 units (it makes calculations easier). After the 20% increase, his new income would be 120 units.

Since the man spends 70% of his income, his initial expenditure would be 70 units (70% of 100 units). 

After his income increases to 120 units, his new expenditure would be 84 units (70% of 120 units).

To find out what percentage the new expenditure is of the new income, we need to calculate (new expenditure / new income) * 100.

So, (84 / 120) * 100 = 70%.

Therefore, the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is 70%, which is not listed in the answer choices. This could indicate a mistake in the answer choices, or there may be an error in the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices provided match the correct calculation. The correct answer is 70%.

Q: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Find the original expenditure (when he was spending 70% of his income)
Let's assume his original income was $100. Thus, his original expenditure was 70% of $100 = $70.

Step 2: Find the new income after a 20% increase
Since the income increased by 20%, we need to calculate 120% of the original income.
New income = 120% of $100 = 1.2 * $100 = $120

Step 3: Calculate the new expenditure based on the new income
If the man still spends 70% of his income but now it's $120, his new expenditure would be 70% of $120 = $84.

Therefore, his new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is $84 / $120 = 0.7 = 70%.

So, the correct answer should be a new expenditure of 70%, which is not one of the provided answer choices. The most similar option is (E) 65.5%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 65.5%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the man's new expenditure after his income increases by 20%.

Let's assume the man's income is $100. Initially, he spends 70% of his income, which is 0.7 * $100 = $70.

After his income increases by 20%, his new income becomes $100 + 20% of $100 = $120.

Now, let's calculate his new expenditure. Since he still spends 70% of his new income, his new expenditure is 0.7 * $120 = $84.

Therefore, the man's new expenditure is $84 out of his new income of $120, which is 84/120 = 0.7 or 70%.

Thus, the man's new expenditure after his income increases by 20% is 70%.

Therefore, the correct choice is not among the Answer Choices listed in the question.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is N/A. The correct calculation shows that the man's new expenditure is 70% of his new income, not any of the percentages provided in the answer choices.

Q: Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much they can earn in one hour individually and then combine their earnings per hour to determine how many hours they need to work together to afford the ice cream cake.

Let's break it down step by step:
1. Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake.
2. Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake.
3. Let's assume Sharon earns $x per hour and Karen earns $y per hour.
4. Together, they earn $x + $y per hour working together.
5. To afford the ice cream cake, they need to work for a total of 5 + 4 = 9 hours together.
6. We can set up the equation: 9 * ($x + $y) = cost of the ice cream cake.
7. Since they individually earn enough tips to buy the cake in 5 and 4 hours, respectively, we can calculate $x and $y as follows:
   - Sharon earns enough tips to buy the cake in 5 hours, so 5 * $x = cost of the ice cream cake.
   - Karen earns enough tips to buy the cake in 4 hours, so 4 * $y = cost of the ice cream cake.
8. By solving for $x and $y, we can then calculate the time it takes for them to earn enough tips to buy the cake working together.

I hope breaking down the problem step by step will help you better understand the process of solving it! If you need further clarifications or assistance with the calculations, feel free to ask.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Through the step-by-step breakdown provided, we can determine that the correct answer among the given choices is (B) 2 hours.

Q: Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of work rate. 

Let's first determine the work rates of Sharon and Karen separately. 
Sharon's work rate = 1 ice cream cake / 5 hours = 1/5 cake per hour
Karen's work rate = 1 ice cream cake / 4 hours = 1/4 cake per hour

When they work together, their work rates add up:
Combined work rate = Sharon's work rate + Karen's work rate
Combined work rate = 1/5 + 1/4 = 4/20 + 5/20 = 9/20 cake per hour

To determine how many hours it takes for them to earn enough money to buy the ice cream cake together, we need to find the reciprocal of the combined work rate:
Hours to buy cake together = 1 / Combined work rate
Hours to buy cake together = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours

Thus, it will take them approximately 20/9 hours to buy the ice cream cake together. This simplifies to about 2 hours and 13 minutes, so the answer closest to this is (C) 3 hours.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 3 hours
=========== 3-th CoT ============
Q: Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, first, let's calculate how many tips Sharon earns in 1 hour and how many tips Karen earns in 1 hour.

Sharon earns enough tips to buy the ice cream cake in 5 hours. So, in 1 hour, she earns 1/5 of the tips needed.

Karen, on the other hand, works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the ice cream cake. So, in 1 hour, she earns 1/4 of the tips needed.

When they work together, their combined hourly effort will be the sum of their individual hourly efforts:

Combined hourly effort = Sharon's hourly effort + Karen's hourly effort
Combined hourly effort = 1/5 + 1/4 = 4/20 + 5/20 = 9/20

Now, if they are able to buy the cake together in x hours, then the amount of tips earned by their combined effort in x hours should be equal to the total tips needed to buy the cake, which is 1.

So, the equation for their combined effort is:

(9/20) * x = 1

Now, solve for x:

x = 1 / (9/20)
x = 20 / 9
x = 2.22 hours

Since they cannot work a fraction of an hour, we consider the next closest hour, which is 3 hours.

Therefore, after 3 hours, Sharon and Karen will be able to buy the cake together.

The correct answer choice is (C) 3 hours.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The answer is (C) 3 hours.

Q: If x<0, y>0, and |x^3| > |y^2|, which of the following must be true? Answer Choices: (A) x > y (B) y^2 > x^2 (C) -x^3 < y^2 (D) –x < y (E) x < –y
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can break it down step by step:

Given:
- x < 0
- y > 0
- |x^3| > |y^2|

Step 1: Examine the absolute value inequality |x^3| > |y^2|, and recognize that this means x^3 > y^2 or x^3 < -y^2.

Step 2: Since x < 0 and y > 0, we can immediately rule out x^3 > y^2, as the cube of a negative number is negative and y^2 is positive.

Step 3: Thus, we have x^3 < -y^2. Cubing x gives us a negative value, so we can also rewrite the inequality as -x^3 > y^2.

Step 4: Comparing -x^3 > y^2 to the answer choices:
- (A) x > y: Not necessarily true, as x is negative. 
- (B) y^2 > x^2: Not related to the given information. 
- (C) -x^3 < y^2: This relates to the information we have deduced, so it could be true. 
- (D) -x < y: Not necessarily true, as x is negative and y is positive. 
- (E) x < -y: Given x < 0 and y > 0, this could be true.

Therefore, the statement that must be true among the answer choices is (C) -x^3 < y^2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) -x^3 < y^2.
=========== 2-th CoT ============
Q: If x<0, y>0, and |x^3| > |y^2|, which of the following must be true? Answer Choices: (A) x > y (B) y^2 > x^2 (C) -x^3 < y^2 (D) –x < y (E) x < –y
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we'll start by breaking down the given information:

Given:
x < 0
y > 0
|x^3| > |y^2|

Step 1: Determining the signs of x^3 and y^2 based on x and y.
Since x < 0, x^3 will be negative.
Since y > 0, y^2 will be positive.

Step 2: Comparing |x^3| and |y^2|
Since |x^3| > |y^2|, this means that -x^3 > y^2 or x^3 < -y^2.

Step 3: Evaluating the answer choices:
(A) x > y - This cannot be concluded based on the given information. This statement cannot be determined.
(B) y^2 > x^2 - This statement doesn't necessarily hold based on the given information. Eliminate.
(C) -x^3 < y^2 - This holds true based on our evaluation in Step 2. So, this must be true. 
(D) –x < y - This cannot be inferred from the given information. Eliminate.
(E) x < –y - This also cannot be definitively determined from the information provided. Eliminate.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) -x^3 < y^2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) -x^3 < y^2
=========== 3-th CoT ============
Q: If x<0, y>0, and |x^3| > |y^2|, which of the following must be true? Answer Choices: (A) x > y (B) y^2 > x^2 (C) -x^3 < y^2 (D) –x < y (E) x < –y
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Given: 
1. x < 0 (which means x is negative)
2. y > 0 (which means y is positive)
3. |x^3| > |y^2|

First, let's simplify the inequality |x^3| > |y^2|:
Since x is negative, we can rewrite the absolute value as -x^3 > |y^2| (since the absolute value of a negative number is its positive counterpart)

Now we have: -x^3 > y^2

Based on this inequality, we can say that x^3 is positive (because we are dealing with the negative side: -x^3). And similarly, y^2 is positive.

Now, we know that x is negative and x^3 is positive, meaning that x^3 is more negative than x itself. With the same logic, y is positive and y^2 is positive, meaning that y^2 is greater than y.

From the inequality -x^3 > y^2, we can see that y^2 is greater than -x^3. So, we can write: y^2 > -x^3

Option (C) -x^3 < y^2 is incorrect based on our analysis.

Thus, the correct answer must be one that aligns with our conclusions. Let’s evaluate the answer choices:

(A) x > y: We know x is negative and y is positive, so x is less than y. This is incorrect.

(B) y^2 > x^2: We cannot determine the relationship between y^2 and x^2 based on the provided information. This is inconclusive.

(C) -x^3 < y^2: We have already determined that this statement is incorrect.

(D) –x < y: Since x is negative and y is positive, it is true that -x is less than y. This could be the correct choice.

(E) x < –y: We know x is negative and y is positive, which does not satisfy this inequality. This is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is (D) –x < y.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) –x < y

Q: Printer A and Printer B can each print 1⁄2 page per second. How long will it take both printers working together to print 100 pages? Answer Choices: (A) 25 seconds (B) 50 seconds (C) 100 seconds (D) 200 seconds (E) 400 seconds
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first find the combined rate at which Printer A and Printer B can print pages together.

Since each printer can print 1/2 page per second, the combined rate is 1/2 page per second + 1/2 page per second = 1 page per second.

Now, to find how long it will take both printers together to print 100 pages, we can set up a proportion:

100 pages / 1 page per second = X seconds, where X is the unknown time.

Solving for X:

X = 100 pages / 1 page per second
X = 100 seconds

Therefore, it will take both printers working together 100 seconds to print 100 pages.

The correct answer choice is (C) 100 seconds.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to find the combined rate at which Printer A and Printer B can print pages per second.

Since Printer A can print 1/2 page per second and Printer B can also print 1/2 page per second, together they can print 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 page per second.

Now, we want to find out how long it will take for both printers working together to print 100 pages. To do this, we can set up a proportion:

Let x be the time it takes to print 100 pages working together.

1 page / 1 second = 100 pages / x seconds

Cross multiply to solve for x:

1 * x = 1 * 100
x = 100

Therefore, it will take both printers working together 100 seconds to print 100 pages. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C) 100 seconds.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can determine the combined printing rate of Printer A and Printer B working together, and then use that rate to calculate the total time needed to print 100 pages.

1. Printer A and Printer B each print at a rate of 1/2 page per second. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 page per second.

2. To print 100 pages at a rate of 1 page per second, we can use the following formula to calculate the total time needed:

Time = Total Pages / Combined Rate
Time = 100 pages / 1 page per second
Time = 100 seconds

Therefore, it will take both printers working together 100 seconds to print 100 pages. The correct answer choice is (C) 100 seconds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 100 seconds

Q: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 51 (D) 54 (E) 57
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up a relative speed equation to determine how long it will take for the ants to meet. Once we find the time it takes for them to meet, we can calculate the distance ant A travels until meeting ant B.

Let the time taken for the ants to meet be T hours.

The total distance traveled by ant A would be 9T cm.
The total distance traveled by ant B would be 6T cm.

Since they are moving towards each other, the sum of the distances traveled by both ants will be equal to the total distance between the farms:

9T + 6T = 75
15T = 75
T = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance ant A travels until meeting ant B by substituting T back into the equation:

Distance traveled by ant A = 9 cm/hour * 5 hours = 45 cm

Therefore, the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is 45 cm. So, the correct answer is (A) 45.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 45

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the time it takes for the two ants to meet. Since they are moving towards each other, their combined speed is 9 cm/h + 6 cm/h = 15 cm/h.

The time it takes for them to meet can be calculated using the formula:
Time = Distance/Combined Speed
Time = 75 cm / 15 cm/h
Time = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance that Ant A travels until meeting Ant B by multiplying Ant A's speed by the time it takes to meet:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 9 cm/h * 5 hours
Distance = 45 cm

Therefore, the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is 45 cm, which corresponds to answer choice (A).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 45

If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 51 (D) 54 (E) 57
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to determine how long it will take for the two ants to meet each other.

Let the distance traveled by ant A until meeting ant B be x cm.

Since ant A is moving at 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at 6 cm per hour, the total distance traveled by both ants when they meet will be 75 cm.

This means that the time it takes for ant A to travel the distance x plus the time it takes for ant B to travel the remaining distance 75 - x will be the same.

The time it takes for ant A to travel distance x is x / 9 hours, and the time it takes for ant B to travel the remaining distance 75 - x is (75 - x) / 6 hours.

Setting up the equation:
x / 9 = (75 - x) / 6

Now, let's solve for x:

6x = 9(75 - x)
6x = 675 - 9x
15x = 675
x = 45

Therefore, ant A will travel 45 cm until meeting ant B. So, the answer choice is (A) 45.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 45

Q: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Answer Choices: (A) 9 Trousers (B) 8 Trousers (C) 10 Trousers (D) 7 Trousers (E) 11 Trousers
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we need to determine how many trousers can be bought with $810 and then calculate the corresponding number of shirts.

Let's denote the number of trousers bought as T and the number of shirts bought as S. The cost of each trouser is $70 and each shirt is $30.

Given that the total amount spent is $810:
70T + 30S = 810

To maximize the number of trousers, we need to spend all $810 on trousers. Therefore, we can set the number of shirts bought to 0:
70T = 810
T = 810 / 70
T = 8100 / 700
T = 81 / 7
T = 11.57

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a trouser, we take the maximum number of trousers bought to be 11 and the number of shirts to be 0.

Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is 11:0, which simplifies to 11:0.

Hence, the correct answer is not included in the answer choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Answer Choice (E) 11 Trousers

Q: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased? Answer Choices: (A) 9 Trousers (B) 8 Trousers (C) 10 Trousers (D) 7 Trousers (E) 11 Trousers
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, here's how you can approach solving this problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1 trouser and 1 shirt to get the total cost spent on each.

Cost of 1 trouser = Rs. 70
Cost of 1 shirt = Rs. 30

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on buying trousers and shirts.

Let the number of trousers purchased be denoted by 't', and the number of shirts purchased be denoted by 's'.

Total cost = 70t + 30s = Rs. 810

Step 3: Since we want to maximize the number of trousers purchased, it means the total cost spent on shirts should be minimized. Therefore, let's maximize the number of trousers purchased.

Let's consider the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased, so let 't' be the maximum number of trousers and 's' be the corresponding number of shirts.

Given, total cost = Rs. 810

Therefore, substituting the values, we get:

70t + 30s = 810

Since we want to maximize the number of trousers (t), we should choose the maximum possible value for 't' that still satisfies the equation.

Step 4: Now, solve for t using the equation 70t + 30s = 810.

Let's begin by considering the possible values for t around the range given in the answer choices to determine the correct ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or explanation on any step!

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 10 Trousers

By solving the equation 70t + 30s = 810 with the constraint of maximizing the number of trousers (t), the value of t that satisfies this condition and fits within the total cost of Rs. 810 is 10 trousers. This choice represents the scenario when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find out the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we can start by setting up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of trousers purchased as T and the number of shirts purchased as S.

Given:
Cost of each trouser = Rs 70
Cost of each shirt = Rs 30
Total amount spent = Rs 810

From the given information, we can write the following equations:
70T + 30S = 810  (1)  [Total amount spent equation]
To maximize the number of trousers purchased, we need to spend the entire amount on trousers. This means we want to find the maximum value of T where the total amount spent equals Rs 810.

Now, let's solve equation (1) for T when S is minimized (since we want to maximize T):
70T + 30S = 810
70T + 30(0) = 810  [minimize S]
70T = 810
T = 810 / 70
T = 81 / 7
T = 11.57 (approx.)

Since we can't purchase a fraction of a trouser, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 11.

So, the correct answer is (E) 11 Trousers.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 11 Trousers

Q: If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? Answer Choices: (A) $7.73 (B) $6.73 (C) $5.73 (D) $4.73 (E) $3.73
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: We know that the subscription for 15 issues of the magazine costs $42.00. So, the cost per issue can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of issues. Therefore, $42.00 / 15 = $2.80 per issue.

Step 2: The subscription represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. This means that the subscriber is paying only 75% of the original cover price. So, we need to find out what is 75% of the cover price.

Step 3: Let X be the original cover price per issue. We know that 75% of X is $2.80 (cost per issue after discount). Therefore, we can set up the equation: 0.75X = $2.80.

Step 4: Solve for X by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75: X = $2.80 / 0.75 = $3.73.

Therefore, the cover price per issue of the magazine is $3.73. The correct answer choice is (E) $3.73.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) $3.73

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. The subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, which is a 25% saving on the cover price.
2. Let's denote the cover price per issue as "x". Since the subscription represents a 25% saving, the subscription price is 75% of the cover price per issue.

Now, let's set up the equation:
15x = $42.00  (Total cost of subscription is cover price per issue times number of issues)
0.75x = $42.00  (75% of the cover price per issue is the subscription price)

Now, we can solve for x:
0.75x = $42.00
x = $42.00 / 0.75
x = $56.00

Therefore, the cover price per issue is $56.00.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct cover price per issue is $56.00. However, this amount is not one of the answer choices provided in A through E. It seems that there was a mistake in the calculation.

Let's reexamine the calculation to determine the accurate cover price per issue:

To calculate the cover price per issue correctly:

Given:
Subscription cost for 15 issues = $42.00
Saving on cover price = 25%

Let the cover price per issue be x.

Since the subscription cost is 75% of the cover price (as it represents a 25% saving), we can set up the equation:

Subscription cost = Number of issues × Cover price per issue
42.00 = 15x

Solving for x:
x = 42.00 / 15
x = $2.80

Therefore, the cover price per issue is $2.80, which is not among the provided answer choices. It appears that there might be a mistake in the options provided for this problem.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the cover price per issue, we first need to determine the original price of the 15 issues without the 25% discount. 

Let x be the cover price per issue. The total cost before the discount is 15 * x.

Given that the cost of the subscription is $42.00, and it represents a 25% saving, we can set up the following equation:

15 * x = $42.00
x = $42.00 / 15
x = $2.80

This means the cover price per issue without the discount is $2.80. 

To find the cover price after the 25% discount, we need to subtract the discount amount from the original price:

Discount amount = 25% * $2.80 = 0.25 * $2.80 = $0.70

Cover price per issue after the discount = $2.80 - $0.70 = $2.10

Therefore, the cover price per issue is $2.10, which is not provided in the answer choices. The original question seems to have an error in the answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is There seems to be an error in the answer choices provided for this question. The correct cover price per issue after applying a 25% discount would be $2.10, not within the given answer choices. You may want to verify the possible error in either the provided answer choices or the calculations. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!

Q: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets.

After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine how many times the coin landed on Heads, we can set up equations based on the information given in the problem.

Let H represent the number of times the coin landed on Heads.
Let T represent the number of times the coin landed on Tails.

According to the problem:
- Every time the coin lands on Heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan.
- Every time the coin lands on Tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher.

Since they ended up with no net loss or gain, the total amount Christopher gave Jonathan equals the total amount Jonathan gave Christopher.
Therefore, we can write the following equation based on the number of times the coin lands on Heads and Tails:
2H = 3T

Now, we know that there were a total of 20 flips:
H + T = 20

To solve for the number of times the coin landed on Heads, we can substitute for T in the second equation using the first equation:
H + 2H/3 = 20
Multiplying by 3 to clear the fraction:
3H + 2H = 60
5H = 60
H = 12

Therefore, the coin landed on Heads 12 times. So, the correct answer choice is (E) 12.

How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can break it down by assigning variables:

Let x be the number of times the coin landed on Heads.
Since each time the coin landed on Heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan, the total amount transferred from Christopher to Jonathan in terms of x is 2x.
Similarly, since each time the coin landed on Tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher, the total amount transferred from Jonathan to Christopher in terms of x is 3(20-x) = 60-3x.

Given that at the end of 20 flips, no money was won or lost, then 2x = 60 - 3x.

Solving for x:
2x + 3x = 60
5x = 60
x = 12

Therefore, the coin landed on heads 12 times. The answer is (E) 12.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 12

How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand that for every Head, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan, and for every Tail, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher. Since no money was exchanged after the twenty flips, the total amount gained by Christopher must be equal to the total amount gained by Jonathan.

Let's assume that the coin landed on Heads x times. Therefore, it landed on Tails (20 - x) times.

The total amount gained by Christopher from Heads = $2 * x
The total amount gained by Jonathan from Tails = $3 * (20 - x)

Since the total gains are equal, we can set up an equation:

$2 * x = $3 * (20 - x)

Now let's solve this equation:

$2x = $60 - $3x
$5x = $60
x = 12

Therefore, the coin landed on Heads 12 times. So the answer is (E) 12.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 12

Q: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the distance between X and Y be D km.
2. When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, let's say after T hours, the total distance each has traveled is D km.
3. Consider the time taken by Allen to reach Y as T1 hours and Bob to reach X as T2 hours.
4. Since Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob at 78 kmph, then:
   Distance traveled by Allen in T1 hours = 54 * T1
   Distance traveled by Bob in T2 hours = 78 * T2
5. Using the relationship of time, distance, and speed, we know that Distance = Speed * Time.
6. So, D = 54 * T1 and D = 78 * T2.
7. When they meet for the first time, the total distance traveled by both is D.
   So, 54 * T1 + 78 * T2 = D.
8. Also, given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time:
   78 * (T1 + T2) = 54 * (T1 + T2) + 48.
9. Now, you have two equations:
   a. 54 * T1 + 78 * T2 = D
   b. 78 * (T1 + T2) = 54 * (T1 + T2) + 48

You can now solve these equations simultaneously to find the distance between X and Y. Let me know if you need further assistance in solving these equations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the equations mentioned earlier to find the distance between X and Y.

From equation (a): 54 * T1 + 78 * T2 = D
From equation (b): 78 * (T1 + T2) = 54 * (T1 + T2) + 48

Let's simplify equation (b) first:
78 * T1 + 78 * T2 = 54 * T1 + 54 * T2 + 48
24 * T1 + 24 * T2 = 48
T1 + T2 = 2

Now, substitute T1 + T2 = 2 back into equation (a):
54 * T1 + 78 * T2 = D
54 * T1 + 78 * (2 - T1) = D
54 * T1 + 156 - 78 * T1 = D
-24 * T1 + 156 = D

As Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time, we have:
78 * 2 = 54 * 2 + 48
156 = 108 + 48

Now, substituting the value of D = 156 back into the equations, we find that the distance between X and Y is 156 km.

Therefore, based on the calculations, none of the provided answer choices (A) 144km, (B) 72 km, (C) 126km, (D) 84 km, or (E) 48km are correct. The correct distance between X and Y is 156 km.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let the distance between X and Y be D km.
2. When they meet for the first time, Allen and Bob cover a total distance of D km.
3. Allen covers D km at 54 kmph, so the time taken for the first meeting is D/54 hours.
4. Bob covers D km at 78 kmph, so the time taken for the first meeting is D/78 hours.
5. When they meet for the second time, Allen has covered a total distance of 2D km (to Y and back), and Bob has covered 2D + 48 km.
6. The time taken for the second meeting is still the same since they both start at the same time. Thus, the total travel time for Bob is (2D + 48)/78 hours, and for Allen is 2D/54 hours.
7. Since the total travel time is the same, we can set up the equation (2D + 48)/78 = 2D/54.
8. Solving this equation will give us the value of D, which is the distance between X and Y.
9. After finding the value of D, we can check which answer choice matches the calculated value.

Let's solve the equation and find the distance between X and Y.

Q: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem into steps:

1. Let the distance between X and Y be d kilometers.
2. Allen and Bob are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 54 km/h + 78 km/h = 132 km/h.
3. Let T be the time taken (in hours) for them to meet for the first time.
4. Since they cover the distance between X and Y in T hours, the equation becomes d = 132T.
5. After the first meeting, Allen covers a distance of 54T km, and Bob covers a distance of 78T km.
6. The total distance both Allen and Bob travel before meeting again is d + d = 2d km.
7. The time taken for them to meet for the second time is 2T hours.
8. Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time, the equation becomes 78 * 2T = 54 * 2T + 48.
9. By solving the above equation, we can find the value of T.
10. Once we have found the value of T, we can substitute it back into the equation d = 132T to find the distance between X and Y.

Let's follow these steps carefully to arrive at the correct answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 126 km.

Q: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cost of new tires: $180 per tire, lasting for 4 years.
Total cost for new tires = $180/tire x 4 tires = $720

2. Cost of repairing current tires: $40 per tire, lasting for 1 additional year.
Total cost for repair = $40/tire x 4 tires = $160

3. Cost per year for new tires: Total cost for new tires / number of years they last = $720 / 4 = $180 per year

4. Cost per year for repairing current tires: Total cost for repair / additional year they last = $160 / 1 = $160 per year

5. Calculate the percentage difference between the cost per year for new tires and repairing current tires:
Percentage difference = [(Cost per year for new tires - Cost per year for repairing current tires) / Cost per year for repairing current tires] x 100

= [($180 - $160) / $160] x 100 = (20 / 160) x 100 = 0.125 x 100 = 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

So, the correct answer is (C) 12.5%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 12.5%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the average cost per year of the new tires and compare it to the cost of repairing the current tires, we can use the following approach:

1. Cost of new tires for four years: $180 per tire x 4 years = $720.
2. Average cost per year for new tires: $720 / 4 years = $180 per year.
3. Cost of repairing current tires for one year: $40 per tire x 4 tires = $160.

To find the difference in cost between the new tires and repairing the current tires per year:
$180 (new tires per year) - $160 (repairing current tires per year) = $20.

To find the percentage increase of the new tires over repairing the current tires:
$20 / $160 x 100% = 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. 

The correct answer choice is (C) 12.5%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 12.5%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Certainly! To find the average cost per year of the new tires, we first need to calculate the cost of purchasing new tires for 4 years. 

Cost of new tires for 4 years:
4 years x $180 per tire = $720 per tire

Now, to find the average cost per year of the new tires, we divide the total cost by the number of years:
$720 / 4 years = $180 per year

Next, let's calculate the cost of repairing the current tires and making them last one additional year. 

Cost of repairing current tires for 1 year:
$40 per tire x 4 tires = $160

To find the average cost per year of repairing the current tires, we divide the total cost by the number of years:
$160 / 1 year = $160 per year

Now, to find the percentage difference between the cost of the new tires and the repaired current tires, we use the formula: 

Percentage Difference = ((New Tires Cost - Repair Cost) / Repair Cost) x 100%

Plugging in the values:
((180 - 160) / 160) x 100% = (20 / 160) x 100% = 0.125 x 100% = 12.5%

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. The answer is (C) 12.5%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 12.5%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let x represent the length of the longer piece of rope.
Then the length of the shorter piece of rope would be x - 3.

Since the total length of the rope is 20 meters, we can write the equation:
x + (x - 3) = 20

Solving this equation gives:
2x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

Q: Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the interest accrued on the bond at maturity, we need to consider the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the amount at maturity
P = the principal amount ($5,000)
r = the annual interest rate (12% or 0.12)
n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year (twice since it's compounded every six months)
t = the number of years the money is invested (1 year in this case)

Plugging the values into the formula:

A = $5,000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1) = $5,000(1.06)^2 = $5,000(1.1236) = $5618

Now, to find out how much interest had accrued at maturity, we need to subtract the initial principal amount:

Interest accrued = Amount at maturity - Principal
Interest accrued = $5618 - $5000 = $618

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (B) $618.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) $618.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
r = annual interest rate (in decimal form).
n = number of times that interest is compounded per year.
t = time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
P = $5,000
r = 12% or 0.12
n = 2 (compounded every six months)
t = 1 year

Plugging in the values:

A = $5,000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)
A = $5,000(1 + 0.06)^2
A = $5,000(1.06)^2
A = $5,000(1.1236)
A = $5,618

Therefore, the bond would have accrued $5,618 at maturity. 

The correct answer choice is (A) $5,618.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) $5,618

A = $5,000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)
   = $5,000(1 + 0.06)^2
   = $5,000(1.06)^2
   = $5,000(1.1236)

To find the interest accrued, subtract the principal amount from the total amount at maturity:

Interest = $5,618 - $5,000
              = $618

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $618.

A M I D Answer Choices: (A) 9 2 0 0 (B) 9 2 0 9 (C) 9 2 0 1 (D) 9 2 0 7 (E) 9 2 2 2
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To decipher the multiplication table provided, let's break it down step by step:

1. First row: MAD x BE = MAD. Based on the multiplication, we can see that the product of D (last digit) and E (last digit) should result in D. This means D x E = D. The only way this is possible is if E is 1 (since any digit multiplied by 1 equals itself). Therefore, E = 1.

2. Second row: MAD x BE = RAE. Now that we know E = 1, we can rewrite the second row as MAD x B1 = RA1. Multiplying A (second digit) by 1 should result in A (second digit), so A x 1 = A. Thus, A = 1.

3. Third row: AMID x AMID = AMID. Now that we know A = 1, we can rewrite the third row as 1M1D x 1M1D = 1M1D. This means that multiplying D by itself results in D, so D x D = D. The only digit that fits this criterion is 1, since 1 x 1 = 1. Therefore, D = 1.

4. We have found values for A, D, and E, so let's substitute them into the final equation: 1M1 x 1M1 = 1MI1. Multiplying 1 by M should result in M, so M x 1 = M. Therefore, M = 1.

Putting it all together, the solution is 1 1 1 1, which corresponds to answer choice (C) 9 2 0 1.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 9 2 0 1

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To decipher the multiplication table, we need to understand the relationships between the letters and numbers involved. Let's break it down step by step:

1. From the first row, we have "MAD" multiplied by "BE" equals "MAD."
2. From the second row, we have "MAD" multiplied by "RAE" equals "AMID."

Now let's look closer at the relationship between the letters in each row:

- In the first row, "MAD * BE = MAD." This suggests that when you multiply "BE" by a number (represented by "MAD"), you get the result as "MAD." This means that "BE" multiplied by 1 equals "MAD."
- In the second row, "MAD * RAE = AMID." This suggests that when you multiply "RAE" by "MAD," it results in "AMID."

Based on the relationships above, we can determine the values of the letters as follows:

- B * E = A (from the first row)
- M * R * A * E = A * M * I * D (from the second row)

Given the choices provided, let's test them to see which one satisfies the relationship:

- Let's try answer choice (B): 9 * 2 = 18 ≠ 9. Thus, (B) is not the correct answer.

By repeating this process of substitution and testing for each answer choice, we can eventually identify the correct solution.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 9 2 0 1.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote Ajay's current age as x.
2. Hence, Sachin's current age would be 2x (as Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back).
3. Given that in 10 years, Sachin will be 40 years old, we set up an equation:
   (Sachin's current age) + 10 = 40
   2x + 10 = 40
4. Solve for x:
   2x + 10 = 40
   2x = 40 - 10
   2x = 30
   x = 30 / 2
   x = 15

Therefore, Ajay is currently 15 years old. 

So, the answer is (C) 15.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's represent Ajay's age as A and Sachin's age as S. Based on the information given:

1. Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back:
S - 10 = 2(A - 10)

2. Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years:
S + 10 = 40

Now, we'll substitute the second equation into the first equation to find the value of A (Ajay's current age).

(S + 10) - 10 = 2(A - 10)

S = 2(A - 10)

Now, substitute S = 40 into the equation:

40 = 2(A - 10)

40 = 2A - 20

60 = 2A

A = 30

Therefore, Ajay is currently 30 years old. 

But since 30 is not in the answer choices, let's correct our calculations. Ajay was 30 years old 10 years ago, so he is now 30 + 10 = 40 years old. This matches with the information we had about Sachin being 40 years old in 10 years.

So, the correct answer is that Ajay is currently 40 years old, which is not listed among the choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the answer choices A, B, C, D, or E are the correct answer to this question. The correct answer is that Ajay is currently 40 years old.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, we can solve this problem step by step.

Let's first define the current ages of Sachin and Ajay. Let's say Sachin's current age is S and Ajay's current age is A.

According to the information given in the problem:
1. Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back:
This can be represented as S - 10 = 2(A - 10).

2. Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years:
This can be written as S + 10 = 40.

Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables:
1. S - 10 = 2(A - 10)
2. S + 10 = 40

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the current age of Ajay (A). Let's solve the equations step by step:

From equation 2: S = 40 - 10
S = 30

Now substitute the value of S into equation 1:

20 = 2A - 20
2A = 40
A = 40 / 2
A = 20

Q: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? Answer Choices: (A) 3400 (B) 1700 (C) 3440 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To find the cost of gardening the 1-metre wide boundary around the rectangular plot, we first need to find the dimensions of the rectangular plot.

Let's denote the length of the plot as L and the width as W. Since the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2(L + W), we have:

2(L + W) = 340

Next, we know that the length of the rectangle with the additional 1-metre wide boundary on each side will be L + 2 and the width will be W + 2. This means the new perimeter will be:

2(L + 2 + W + 2) = 2(L + W) + 8

Given that the new perimeter is 340m (as it includes the extra width of 1 metre on each side), we have:

2(L + W) + 8 = 340

Substitute the value of 2(L + W) from the first equation:

340 + 8 = 340

348 = 2(L + W)
174 = L + W

Now we need to find the area of the rectangular plot with the 1-meter wide boundary, which will be (L + 2)(W + 2). Substituting the values we found:

Area = (174 + 2)(174 + 2) = 176*176 = 30976 square meters

Finally, the cost of gardening would be the area multiplied by the rate, which is $10 per square meter:

Cost = 30976 * 10 = $309760

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (E) None of these.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E) None of these.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the cost of gardening a 1-meter-wide boundary around a rectangular plot, we first need to find the dimensions of the rectangular plot.

Let the length of the plot be L meters and the width be W meters.

Given that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters, we have:
2(L + W) = 340
L + W = 170 [Equation 1]

Since we want to find the cost of gardening a 1-meter-wide boundary around the plot, the dimensions of the new plot with the boundary will be:
Length: L + 2(1) = L + 2 meters
Width: W + 2(1) = W + 2 meters

The new perimeter of the plot with the boundary will now be:
2(L + 2) + 2(W + 2) = 2L + 4 + 2W + 4
2L + 2W + 8 = 340
2L + 2W = 332
L + W = 166 [Equation 2]

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:
166 = 166

This means the original and modified dimensions of the rectangular plot are the same. Therefore, the cost of gardening the 1-meter-wide boundary around the plot is equal to the cost of gardening the entire plot.

The area of the plot is given by:
Area = Length x Width
Area = L x W

Since we know that the area is the same and the cost is given as 10 per square meter, the cost of gardening the 1-meter-wide boundary around the plot would be:
Cost = Area x Cost per square meter
Cost = L x W x 10
Cost = 170 x 10
Cost = 1700

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (B) 1700.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 1700

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Certainly! To find the cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot, we first need to calculate the area of the rectangular plot and then subtract the area of the inner rectangle to find the area of the boundary. Let's follow these steps:

1. Calculate the dimensions of the rectangular plot:
Let the length of the rectangle be L meters and the breadth be B meters. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(L + B), and in this case, the perimeter is given as 340 meters:
2(L + B) = 340
L + B = 170

2. Calculate the area of the inner rectangle:
The inner rectangle's dimensions will be (L-2) and (B-2) to account for the 1-meter boundary on all sides. Therefore, the area of the inner rectangle is (L-2)(B-2).

3. Calculate the area of the boundary:
Once we have the area of the inner rectangle, we can find the area of the boundary by subtracting the area of the inner rectangle from the area of the larger rectangle:
Area of boundary = LB - (L-2)(B-2)

4. Calculate the cost of gardening the boundary:
Finally, multiply the area of the boundary by the rate of 10 per square meter to get the total cost of gardening.

By following these steps, we can solve the problem and determine the correct answer choice. Let me know if you need help with the calculations or have any other questions!

Q: Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use some algebra to find the approximate ratio of revenue from the sale of novels to revenue from the sale of biographies.

Let the total sales revenue be 100.

From the given information:
- Revenue from the sale of novels = 34% of 100 = 34
- Remaining revenue = 100 - 34 = 66
- Revenue from the sale of biographies = 1/3 of the remaining revenue = 1/3 * 66 = 22

To find how many times the revenue from the sale of novels is compared to the revenue from the sale of biographies:
34 / 22 ≈ 1.54

So, the revenue from the sale of novels was approximately 1.54 times the revenue from the sale of biographies.

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (B) 1.5

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 1.5

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of revenue from the sale of novels to revenue from the sale of biographies.

Let's denote the total revenue as 100 (for easier calculations since 34% + 66% = 100%).

Revenue from the sale of novels = 34% of 100 = 34
Remaining revenue = 100 - 34 = 66

Revenue from the sale of biographies = 1/3 of 66 = 22

Now, to find the ratio of revenue from the sale of novels to biographies:
34 / 22 = 1.545

So, the company's revenue from the sale of novels is approximately 1.5 times its revenue from the sale of biographies.

Therefore, the answer choice is (B) 1.5.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the revenue from the sale of novels to the revenue from the sale of biographies.

1. Revenue from novels: Since 34% of the revenue came from novels, we can represent this as 0.34 (when dealing with percentages, converting to a decimal is helpful).

2. Revenue from biographies: From the remaining revenue, 1/3 came from biographies. With 34% from novels, the remaining percentage is 100% - 34% = 66%. Thus, the revenue from biographies can be represented as (1/3)*0.66 = 0.22.

3. Ratio of revenue from novels to biographies: To find the ratio, we divide the revenue from novels by the revenue from biographies:
Ratio = 0.34 / 0.22 = 1.545

So, the company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately 1.5 times its revenue from the sale of biographies. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (B) 1.5.

Q: A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers? Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the number of flowers the bee will fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we need to find the total number of flowers that the bee would have encountered in order to bypass 8 flowers.

Given that the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by, it means that it actually visits 99.95% of the flowers it encounters (100% - 0.05% = 99.95%).

To bypass 8 flowers, the bee would have visited 8 / 0.9995 (99.95%) flowers.

Let's calculate this:
8 / 0.9995 = 8008 flowers

Therefore, the bee will fly by 8008 flowers to bypass 8 flowers.

Answer: The bee will fly by 8008 flowers, which is not one of the answer choices provided. It seems there might be a mistake in the options provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is there might be a mistake in the options provided. The correct answer based on the calculations would be 8008 flowers.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the number of flowers the bee will fly by in order to bypass 8 flowers, we can set up a proportion based on the percentage of flowers bypassed by the bee:

0.05% of flowers bypassed = 8 flowers

Let x be the total number of flowers the bee flies by.

Then we can set up a proportion to solve for x:

0.05/100 = 8/x

Cross multiply to solve for x:

0.05x = 800

x = 800 / 0.05
x = 16000

So, the bee will fly by 16,000 flowers in order to bypass 8 flowers. Therefore, the answer is (D) 16000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 16000

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of flowers the bee will fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we can set up a proportion where 0.05% represents the flowers bypassed and X represents the total number of flowers the bee will fly by:

0.05% = 8/X

Converting 0.05% to a decimal, we get 0.0005:

0.0005 = 8/X

To find X, we can rearrange the equation:

X = 8 / 0.0005
X = 16000

Therefore, the bee will fly by 16000 flowers. So, the correct answer is (D) 16000.

Answer Choices: (A) 5C3*4C3 (B) 5C4*4C2 (C) 5C2*4C4 (D) 5C6*4C5 (E) 4C3*4C3
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the number of options Fernando has to allocate his meals, we need to consider how many ways he can choose his 3 lunches and 3 dinners from the available options during the week, considering that he goes home for dinner on Friday nights.

1. Fernando chooses 3 out of the 5 weekdays to have lunch. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 5C3 = 10 ways (A)

2. Since the cafeteria is closed on weekends, Fernando only needs to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 weekdays to have dinner. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 4C2 = 6 ways (B)

3. To find the total number of options for Fernando to allocate his meals, we multiply the number of ways for lunches and dinners: 10 * 6 = 60.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (A) 5C3 * 4C2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 5C3*4C2

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints given in the question.

1. Fernando has a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week.
2. The cafeteria is closed on weekends.
3. Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights.

Considering these constraints, let's calculate the options Fernando has to allocate his meals.

Fernando has 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. Since he always goes home for Friday night dinner, he has 3 dinners available for other days of the week (non-Friday dinners).

For lunches, he has 3 options, and for dinners (excluding Friday night), he has 3 options as well.

So, the total number of ways to allocate his meals would be the product of the number of ways to choose 3 lunches from 3 options and the number of ways to choose 3 dinners from 3 options:

Total options = 3C3 * 3C3  
Total options = 1 * 1  
Total options = 1

Therefore, the correct answer should be (E) 4C3 * 4C3, as shown above.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 4C3 * 4C3

2. Since he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights, that leaves him with 4 days (Monday to Thursday) to choose 3 dinners from.
3. Therefore, Fernando has to choose 3 lunches from 5 options (5C3) and 3 dinners from 4 options (4C3) for the weekdays.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A) 5C3*4C3.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve the given expression, let's expand the left side of the equation and compare it with the right side to determine the correct answer choice.

Given expression: (a2 - b2) / (a + b)2 = (a - b)2

First, let's expand the left side of the equation:

(a2 - b2) / (a + b)2 = (a - b)(a + b) / (a + b)2  [Using the difference of squares formula: a2 - b2 = (a - b)(a + b)]

Now, simplify the expression on the left side by canceling out (a+b) from the numerator and denominator:

(a - b)(a + b) / (a + b)2 = (a - b) / (a + b)

Compare this result with the expression on the right side, (a - b)2:

(a - b) is equal to (a - b)2 only when the power matches, in this case, the power is 2.

Therefore, the correct answer choice to replace the question mark is (C) (a + b)2.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the missing term in the equation a^2 - b^2 / (a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2, we can begin by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation.

Recall that a^2 - b^2 can be factored as (a + b)(a - b). Additionally, (a + b)^2 can be expanded as (a + b)(a + b).

Therefore, the left-hand side of the equation becomes:
(a + b)(a - b) / (a + b)(a + b)

Now, we can cancel out the common term (a + b) in the numerator and denominator to simplify the expression:
(a - b) / (a + b)

This simplifies to (a - b)/(a + b), which is the same as (a - b)^2.

Thus, the missing term should be (C) (a + b)2.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) (a + b) 2

Before replacing the question mark with the correct answer choice, let's break down the given expression and simplify it step by step.

The expression given is:

We can simplify the left side of the equation using the formula for the difference of two squares:
a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)

Now, re-writing the left side of the equation with the simplified form:
[(a + b)(a - b)] / (a + b)^2

Next, cancel out (a + b) terms from the numerator and the denominator:
(a - b) / (a + b)

Therefore, the correct answer choice to replace the question mark is:
(C) (a - b)

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Choice (A) (a - b).

Q: A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the Number. Answer Choices: (A) 60 (B) 56 (C) 51 (D) 61 (E) 41
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first set up the equation based on the information provided.

Let's denote the number as "x."

According to the problem, the difference between the number and 36 is the same as the difference between the number and 86. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

|x - 36| = |x - 86|

Now we can solve this equation to find the value of x. Let's break it down step by step:

1. For x >= 86:
When x is greater than or equal to 86, the equation becomes:

x - 36 = x - 86

Solving for x:

x - x = -86 + 36
0 = -50

The equation has no valid solution for x >= 86.

2. For 36 <= x < 86:
When x is between 36 and 86 (inclusive), the equation becomes:

x - 36 = 86 - x

Solving for x:

x + x = 86 + 36
2x = 122
x = 61

Therefore, the number that satisfies the given conditions is 61.

So, the correct answer is (D) 61.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Answer choice (D) 61.

Q: A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the Number. Answer Choices: (A) 60 (B) 56 (C) 51 (D) 61 (E) 41
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
This is a classic problem involving the concept of finding the number that is equidistant from two given numbers. In this case, we are looking for a number that is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86.

Let's denote the unknown number as x. The problem can be written as:

|x - 36| = |x - 86|

To solve this equation, we can consider two cases:

1. If x is greater than or equal to 86:
   In this case, the equation becomes:
   x - 36 = x - 86
   Solving for x, we get:
   x = 61
   
2. If x is less than 86:
   In this case, the equation becomes:
   36 - x = x - 86
   Solving for x, we get:
   x = 61

Therefore, the number that satisfies the given condition is 61 (D).

Q: A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together. Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
The key concept to solve this problem is understanding the rate at which each person works individually and how their rates combine when working together.

1. Let's find the rate of work for person A:
A takes 40 minutes to construct a wall, so the rate of work for A is 1 wall / 40 min = 1/40 walls per minute.

2. Next, let's find the rate of work for person B:
B takes 45 minutes to construct a wall, so the rate of work for B is 1 wall / 45 min = 1/45 walls per minute.

3. When A and B work together, their rates of work add up:
Combined rate = Rate of A + Rate of B
Combined rate = 1/40 + 1/45 = (9 + 8) / (360)
Combined rate = 17 / 360 walls per minute.

4. To find out how long it will take for both A and B to construct a wall together, we need to invert their combined rate to get the time it takes to construct 1 wall:
Time for A and B to construct 1 wall together = 1 / Combined rate
Time for A and B to construct 1 wall together = 360 / 17 minutes.

5. Converting this time into hours:
Time for A and B to construct 1 wall together = 360 / 17 minutes * 1 hour / 60 minutes
Time for A and B to construct 1 wall together ≈ 21.176 hours.

Therefore, the answer is closest to (D) 21 min.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 21 min

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Find the individual rates at which A and B can construct the wall per minute.
A's rate = 1 wall / 40 min = 1/40 walls per minute
B's rate = 1 wall / 45 min = 1/45 walls per minute

Step 2: Add their individual rates to find their combined rate.
Combined rate = 1/40 + 1/45 = 9/360 + 8/360 = 17/360 walls per minute

Step 3: Determine the time needed for A and B to construct the wall together.
Time = 1 / Combined rate = 360 / 17 min ≈ 21.18 min

Therefore, the closest answer choice to the calculated time is (D) 21 min.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can find the rate at which each person constructs the wall per minute. 

A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, so their rate is 1/40 of the wall per minute.
B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so their rate is 1/45 of the wall per minute.

When they work together, their rates add up:
Rate A + Rate B = 1/40 + 1/45 = 9/360 + 8/360 = 17/360

Therefore, working together, A and B construct 17/360 of the wall per minute. To determine how many minutes it will take to construct the entire wall together, we need to find the reciprocal of 17/360 and convert it to hours:

360/17 ≈ 21.18

Therefore, it will take approximately 21.18 minutes for A and B to construct the wall together, which is closest to 21 minutes, or Option (D).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Option (D) 21 min

Q: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the information given in the problem and figure out the solution step by step:

Given:
- The express electric train takes 3 seconds to enter the 1-mile-long tunnel.
- The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.

We need to find out how long it will take for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.

Step 1: Determine the time taken to travel 1 mile at 120 miles per hour. Since speed = distance / time, we can rearrange this formula to find time = distance / speed. Therefore, time taken to travel 1 mile at 120 miles per hour is 1 mile / 120 mph = 1/120 hours.

Step 2: Convert the time taken to travel 1 mile into seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. So, 1/120 hours is equal to (1/120) * 60 * 60 = 3 seconds.

Step 3: Since the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel completely and the tunnel is 1 mile long, it will also take the same amount of time to exit the tunnel. Therefore, the total time the train takes to pass completely through the tunnel is 3 seconds (entering) + 3 seconds (exiting) = 6 seconds.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the provided answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Answer: Not in the given choices.

Q: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the length of the train to determine how long it will take to pass completely through the tunnel.

Given:
- The tunnel is 1 mile long.
- The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel at a speed of 120 miles per hour.

First, let's convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per second:
120 miles per hour = 120/3600 miles per second (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour)
= 1/30 miles per second

Since the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, the distance the train covers when entering the tunnel is:
1/30 mile per second * 3 seconds = 1/10 mile

This means that the train's length is:
1 mile - 1/10 mile (distance already covered while entering the tunnel) = 9/10 mile

Now, we can determine how long it will take for the train to pass completely through the tunnel at its speed of 1/30 mile per second:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = (9/10) mile / (1/30) mile per second
Time = (9/10) / (1/30)
Time = (9/10) * (30/1)
Time = 27 seconds

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (D) 33 seconds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 33 seconds

Q: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find out how long it will take the train to pass completely through the 1-mile long tunnel, we first need to calculate the length of the train. 

Since the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel at a speed of 120 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance the train travels in 3 seconds at 120 miles per hour:

Speed = Distance/Time
120 miles per hour = Distance/3 seconds
Distance = 120 miles per hour * 3 seconds = 360 miles

So, the length of the train is 360 miles. 

Now, the train must travel the length of the tunnel (1 mile) in addition to the length of the train (360 miles) to completely pass through it. 

Total distance = Tunnel length + Train length
Total distance = 1 mile + 360 miles = 361 miles

Now, we need to find out how long it will take the train to pass through the tunnel at a speed of 120 miles per hour:

Time = Distance/Speed
Time = 361 miles / 120 miles per hour
Time = 3.008 hours

But, we need the time in seconds. So, let's convert hours to seconds:

1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds

3.008 hours * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 10828.8 seconds

So, it will take approximately 10828.8 seconds for the express electric train to pass completely through the 1-mile long tunnel. 

None of the answer choices matches this calculation exactly. It is possible that a rounding error occurred during the calculations, or there may be a mistake in the provided information.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Approximately 10828.8 seconds. However, since this answer choice is not provided, it may be best to review the calculations and consider rounding to the closest available option.

Q: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The invoice is for $20,000 with terms 4/30, n/100.
2. This means the merchant can get a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days, otherwise, the full amount is due.
3. The merchant wants to borrow money at a simple interest rate so that he can take advantage of the discount by paying within 30 days.
4. Let's calculate the maximum interest rate at which he can borrow money to pay the discounted amount:
   - Amount after discount = $20,000 - 4% of $20,000 = $20,000 - $800 = $19,200
   - Let's assume he will borrow the full amount for 30 days to pay $19,200.
   - Simple interest = Principal x Rate x Time
   - We need to find the rate (R) that will make the interest affordable, so we can rearrange the formula:
     R = Simple Interest / (Principal x Time)
   - R = (Interest) / ($20,000 x 30/365 days)
   - R = (Interest) / ($20,000 x 0.0821918) = Interest / $1,643.64

Now, we need to calculate the interest he can afford to pay for 30 days on $20,000 to be less than the discount amount of $800 in order to make it worthwhile to borrow the money. Let's calculate the highest simple interest rate he can afford to pay to still save money with the discount.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount:

Given:
- Amount after discount = $19,200
- Discount amount = $20,000 - $19,200 = $800

To determine the highest simple interest rate he can afford to pay, considering that the interest should be less than the discount amount:

Interest < Discount Amount
Interest < $800

Let's calculate the highest affordable interest rate:
Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
Interest = $20,000 x Rate x (30/365) days  (since the terms are 30 days)
Interest = $20,000 x Rate x 0.0821918
Interest < $800
$20,000 x Rate x 0.0821918 < $800
Rate < $800 / ($20,000 x 0.0821918)
Rate < $800 / $1,643.64
Rate < 0.4871

Therefore, the highest affordable simple interest rate the merchant can borrow at is approximately 0.4871 or 48.71%.

Since none of the answer choices provided is an option with this calculated rate, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

Q: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount, we need to calculate the effective annual interest rate that would make it worth paying the invoice within 30 days.

The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can take a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days, otherwise, the full amount is due in 100 days.

First, let's calculate the amount the merchant would need to pay after taking the discount:
$20,000 x (1 - 0.04) = $20,000 x 0.96 = $19,200

The merchant would save $20,000 - $19,200 = $800 by taking the discount.

Next, let's calculate the cost of borrowing $19,200 for 30 days:
Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
Interest = $19,200 x Rate x 30/365

We want to find the interest rate that would make it so that the interest paid on borrowing $19,200 for 30 days is equal to the $800 discount gained.

So, we set up the equation:
$19,200 x Rate x 30/365 = $800

Solve for Rate:
Rate = $800 / ($19,200 x 30/365)
Rate = $800 / ($19,200 x 0.0822)
Rate = $800 / $1,579.20
Rate ≈ 0.5064

To convert this rate to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Rate ≈ 50.64%

Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount is approximately 50.64%, which is not among the answer choices provided.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can take a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days. If not, the full amount is due in 100 days.

2. To calculate the amount the merchant can pay within the discount period: 
$20,000 * 0.04 = $800 (discount)

3. The amount the merchant needs to pay within the discount period to break even on the interest paid for borrowing money can be calculated as:
$20,000 - $800 = $19,200

4. The interest on borrowing money is the difference between the invoice amount and the break-even amount:
Interest = $20,000 - $19,200 = $800

5. The highest simple interest rate can be calculated by dividing the interest amount by the break-even amount and multiplying by 100:
Interest Rate = ($800 / $19,200) * 100 = 4.17%

Therefore, the correct answer is not given in the answer choices provided.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to divide the 10 lime soda bottles into two groups of 5 bottles each. This is a combination problem.

The formula for calculating the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements is given by the combination formula:
C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!),

where:
n! denotes the factorial of n (n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1),
k is the number of elements to be chosen,
n is the total number of elements in the set.

In this case, n = 10 (total lime soda bottles) and k = 5 (to be divided into each group).

To divide the bottles into two groups of 5 bottles each, we need to calculate C(10, 5):

C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * (10 - 5)!) 
C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * 5!) 
C(10, 5) = 3628800 / (120 * 120)
C(10, 5) = 3628800 / 14400
C(10, 5) = 252

Therefore, there are 252 ways to create these two groups. The correct answer choice is (D) 252.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 252

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the number of ways to divide the 10 lime soda bottles among two groups of 5 members each, we can use combinations.

First, we can calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 bottles from 10 lime soda bottles, which is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).

C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * (10 - 5)!) = 252.

This calculates the number of ways to choose 5 bottles for the first group. After that, the remaining 5 bottles automatically belong to the second group. So, there is only one way to distribute the remaining 5 bottles to the second group.

Therefore, the total number of ways to create the two groups is 252 * 1 = 252.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 252.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 252.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To create the two groups of 5 members each from the 10 lime soda bottles, we first need to choose the group of 5 people that will receive the lime soda bottles. This can be done using combinations.

The total number of ways to choose a group of 5 people out of 10 is given by the combination formula: C(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!) = 252.

So, there are 252 ways to create the first group of 5 members. Once this group is chosen, the remaining 5 members will automatically form the second group.

Therefore, the answer is 252, which corresponds to option (D).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 252.

Q: A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? Answer Choices: (A) 6.5 (B) 7.5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find out how much corn is in the mixture, we can start by determining the total ratio of the mixture. Since the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is given as 2:3:5, the total ratio is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts.

If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, we need to find the amount of corn present in the mixture.

Since rice is in a 2:10 ratio in the mixture, and we have 3 pounds of rice, we can calculate the amount of corn using proportions:

3 pounds of rice corresponds to: \( \frac{3}{2+3+5} \times 5 = \frac{3}{10} \times 5 = 1.5 \) pounds of corn.

So, the bag of the mixture contains 1.5 pounds of corn.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (E) None of the above, as the amount of corn is 1.5 pounds.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None of the above

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Understand the given ratio of rice, wheat, and corn is 2:3:5.
Step 2: Let the common multiplier be x.
Step 3: Since the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, this corresponds to 2x = 3.
Step 4: Solve for x: x = 3/2 = 1.5.
Step 5: Multiply x by the components' ratio to find the amount of corn. The amount of corn is 5 * 1.5 = 7.5 pounds.
Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 7.5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 7.5

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, first determine the total weight of the cereal mixture in the bag by adding the weights of the rice, wheat, and corn.

Since the ratio of rice, wheat, and corn is 2:3:5, if the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, the total weight of the mixture is 3 + 3*(3/2 + 3/3 + 5/2) = 3 + 3*(1.5 + 1 + 2.5) = 3 + 3*(5) = 3 + 15 = 18 pounds.

Since corn represents 5 parts in the ratio and there are a total of 10 parts (2+3+5), the weight of corn in the mixture is 5/10 * 18 = 9 pounds.

Therefore, the bag of the mixture contains 9 pounds of corn, which is not listed among the answer choices. This suggests that there may be a mistake in the given answer choices or in the calculations.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the above.

Q: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. Answer Choices: (A) 500 (B) 600 (C) 750 (D) 800 (E) 900
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's start by setting up two equations based on the information given:

Let's denote the cost of one soda as "s" and the cost of one energy bar as "b".

From the first statement, we have:
s + 2b = 150 cents

From the second statement, we have:
2s + 3b = 300 cents

Now, we need to solve the system of equations to find the values of "s" and "b".

First, let's solve the first equation for "s" in terms of "b":
s = 150 - 2b

Now we substitute this expression for "s" into the second equation:
2(150 - 2b) + 3b = 300
300 - 4b + 3b = 300
-b = 0
b = 0

Now, substitute the value of "b" back into the first equation to find the value of "s":
s + 2(0) = 150
s = 150

Therefore, the cost of one soda is 150 cents and the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents. This implies that the costs don't change regardless of quantity.

To find the cost of 6 sodas and 7 energy bars, we can calculate:
6s + 7b = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 cents

So, the cost of 6 sodas and 7 energy bars is 900 cents, which corresponds to answer choice (E) 900.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 900

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the cost of one soda be x and the cost of one energy bar be y in cents.
2. From the first statement, we have:
    1x + 2y = 150
3. From the second statement, we have:
    2x + 3y = 300
4. Now, we need to solve this system of equations. One way to do this is by substitution or elimination.
5. Let's solve for x and y:
    From the first equation:
    x = 150 - 2y
    Substitute x into the second equation:
    2(150 - 2y) + 3y = 300
    300 - 4y + 3y = 300
    -y = 0
    y = 0
    Substitute y back into the first equation:
    x = 150
6. So, one soda costs 150 cents and one energy bar costs 0 cents.
7. Finally, we need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:
    6(150) + 7(0) = 900 cents
8. Therefore, the total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 cents, which corresponds to answer choice (E) 900.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 900

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We have the equation:
   1 soda + 2 energy bars = 150 cents ...(1)
   2 sodas + 3 energy bars = 300 cents ...(2)

2. From equation (1), we can express the cost of one soda in terms of energy bars:
   1 soda = 150 - 2*(cost of one energy bar)
   1 soda = 150 - 2x

3. Substituting this expression for one soda into equation (2), we get:
   2*(150 - 2x) + 3x = 300
   300 - 4x + 3x = 300
   -x = 0
   x = 0

4. Since x = 0, the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents. Plugging this back into equation (1):
   1 soda = 150 - 2*0
   1 soda = 150

5. Therefore, the cost of one soda is 150 cents.

6. Now, to find the cost of 6 sodas and 7 energy bars:
   6 sodas = 6 * 150 = 900 cents
   7 energy bars = 7 * 0 = 0 cents

7. Adding the costs of 6 sodas and 7 energy bars:
   Total cost = 900 + 0 = 900 cents

So, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 cents. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (E) 900.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 900

Q: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the manufacturing cost of each pen, we can set up the equation step by step:

1. Let x be the manufacturing cost of each pen.
2. Since the company promises to deliver 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each, the total revenue from selling the pens is 7200 * Rs. 10 = Rs. 72,000.
3. The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%, so the total profit is 25% of the total revenue: 0.25 * Rs. 72,000 = Rs. 18,000.
4. The total cost of manufacturing all pens is the total revenue minus the total profit: Rs. 72,000 - Rs. 18,000 = Rs. 54,000.
5. Since 10% of the produced pens are defective, the number of good pens is 90% of the total produced pens: 0.90 * 7200 = 6480 pens.
6. The total cost of manufacturing all pens is the manufacturing cost per pen multiplied by the number of good pens: x * 6480 = Rs. 54,000.
7. Solve for x: x = Rs. 54,000 / 6480 = Rs. 8.

Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 8, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) Rs. 8

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the manufactured cost of each pen, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Calculate the total profit expected from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each:
Total revenue = 7200 pens * Rs. 10/pen = Rs. 72,000

2. Since the company estimates an overall profit of 25%, we can calculate the total cost of manufacturing all pens:
Total revenue = Total cost + Total profit
Rs. 72,000 = Total cost + 25% of Total cost
Rs. 72,000 = Total cost + 0.25 * Total cost
Rs. 72,000 = 1.25 * Total cost
Total cost = Rs. 72,000 / 1.25
Total cost = Rs. 57,600

3. Now we need to adjust for the defective pens. Since 10% of the pens are defective and rejected, the actual number of pens manufactured is 90% of the total 7200 pens:
Number of pens manufactured = 7200 pens * 90% = 7200 pens * 0.90 = 6480 pens

4. Calculate the cost of manufacturing each pen:
Manufactured cost per pen = Total cost / Number of pens manufactured
Manufactured cost per pen = Rs. 57,600 / 6480 pens = Rs. 8

Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 8 (Option D).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) Rs. 8

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Total pens promised to the wholesaler: 7200
2. Cost promised to the wholesaler per pen: Rs. 10
3. Overall profit on all manufactured pens: 25%
4. Percentage of defective pens: 10%

Now, let's calculate the number of defective pens and the number of good pens to find the total cost of manufacturing each pen.

1. Number of defective pens: 10% of 7200 = 0.10 x 7200 = 720
2. Number of good pens: Total pens - Defective pens = 7200 - 720 = 6480

Now, let's calculate the total revenue earned from selling all the pens to the wholesaler.
Total revenue = Total pens x Cost per pen
Total revenue = 7200 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 72,000

Since the profit is 25%, let's calculate the total cost of manufacturing all the pens.
Total cost = Total revenue / (1 + Profit Percentage)
Total cost = Rs. 72,000 / 1.25 = Rs. 57,600

Now, we will find the cost of manufacturing each pen by dividing the total cost by the number of good pens produced.
Cost per pen = Total cost / Number of good pens
Cost per pen = Rs. 57,600 / 6480 = Rs. 8

Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 8, which means the correct answer choice is (D) Rs. 8.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) Rs. 8

Q: A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's represent the two-digit number as 10x + y, where x is the digit in the tens place and y is the digit in the units place.

According to the given conditions:
1. The two-digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18:
10x + y = x + y + 18

2. The digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place:
y = 2x

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation and solve for x:
10x + 2x = x + 2x + 18
12x = 2x + 18
10x = 18
x = 1.8

Since x has to be an integer, we see this isn't possible, so the number does not exist based on the given conditions.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is There seems to be an error in the problem statement as the calculated value for x is not a whole number, which is not possible for the digit in the tens place. Thank you for guiding us through the step-by-step breakdown of the problem. Since the number does not exist based on the given conditions, the correct answer would be None of the given choices.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's denote the tens place digit as \( x \) and the units place digit as \( 2x \).

According to the given information:
1. The number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18:
\[ 10x + 2x = x + 2x + 18 \]
\[ 12x = 3x + 18 \]
\[ 9x = 18 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, the tens place digit is 2.

2. The units place digit is double the tens place digit, which we found to be 2:
Hence, the units digit is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \).

Therefore, the number is 24.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (B) 24.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's represent the two-digit number as 10a + b, where 'a' is the digit in the tens place, and 'b' is the digit in the units place.

According to the given conditions, we have:
1. 10a + b = a + b + 18 --(1)  -- The two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18.
2. b = 2a -- (2) -- The digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the tens place.

Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
10a + 2a = a + 2a + 18
12a = 3a + 18
12a - 3a = 18
9a = 18
a = 2

From equation (2), we find:
b = 2 * 2
b = 4

Therefore, the two-digit number is 10(2) + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24

So, the correct answer is (B) 24.

Q: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  ≠ R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To tackle this problem step by step, let's first understand the functions involved.

1. Function L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]: This function calculates the sum of the greatest integer less than or equal to x, the greatest integer less than or equal to y, and the greatest integer less than or equal to x + y.

2. Function R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y]: This function calculates the sum of the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x and the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.

Next, let's analyze the given answer choices:

(A) L(x, y) = R(x, y): This means that the two functions are equal for certain values of x and y. We need to determine if such values exist.

(B) L(x, y) ≠ R(x, y): This would mean that the two functions are never equal for any values of x and y.

(C) L(x, y) < R(x, y): This option implies that the value of L(x, y) is less than the value of R(x, y).

(D) L(x, y) > R(x, y): This option implies that the value of L(x, y) is greater than the value of R(x, y).

Now, we need to consider the properties of the greatest integer function to deduce potential relationships between L(x, y) and R(x, y) and determine if these answer choices are possible or impossible.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B) \( L(x,y) \neq R(x,y) \)

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To compare L(x, y) and R(x, y), let's first simplify them for better understanding.

L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]  
R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y]

Now, let's analyze each function separately:

1. L(x, y):
   - [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
   - [y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to y.
   - [x + y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to the sum of x and y.

2. R(x, y):
   - [2x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x.
   - [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.

Now, let's consider the possible relationships between L(x, y) and R(x, y) for any given x and y:

(A) L(x, y) = R(x, y):
If L(x, y) = R(x, y), it implies that the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to x, y, and x + y is equal to the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y. To satisfy this condition, we need to carefully consider the properties and restrictions of the greatest integer function.

(B) L(x, y) ≠ R(x, y):
If L(x, y) ≠ R(x, y), it implies that the sums of the greatest integers calculated in L(x, y) and R(x, y) are not equal for all x and y. This could be true based on the properties of the greatest integer function and how it behaves with real numbers.

(C) L(x, y) < R(x, y):
If L(x, y) < R(x, y), it means that the sum of the greatest integers in L(x, y) is less than the sum of the greatest integers in R(x, y). This comparison relies on the values of x and y and how the greatest integer function operates with them.

(D) L(x, y) > R(x, y):
If L(x, y) > R(x, y), it means that the sum of the greatest integers in L(x, y) is greater than the sum of the greatest integers in R(x, y). Like the previous case, this comparison is dependent on the values of x and y and the behavior of the greatest integer function.

Given the nature of the greatest integer function and the involved operations in L(x, y) and R(x, y), it is likely that there exist two positive real numbers x and y such that L(x, y) can be less than, greater than, or not equal to R(x, y) under different conditions. 

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) L (x,y) ≠ R (x,y)

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To address this problem step by step, let's first understand the functions L(x, y) and R(x, y) involving the greatest integer function [x].

1. Function L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]:
- The greatest integer less than or equal to x is denoted by [x].
- Therefore, L(x, y) is the sum of three greatest integer functions applied to x, y, and x + y.

2. Function R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y]:
- Here, [2x] represents the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x.
- Similarly, [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.
- R(x, y) is the sum of two greatest integer functions applied to 2x and 2y.

Now, let's analyze the possible relationships between L(x, y) and R(x, y):

- If L(x, y) = R(x, y), it implies that the sum of three greatest integer functions (applied to x, y, and x + y) is equal to the sum of two greatest integer functions (applied to 2x and 2y).
- If L(x, y) ≠ R(x, y), the two expressions have distinct values.
- If L(x, y) < R(x, y), it means that the sum of the three greatest integer functions is less than the sum of the two greatest integer functions.
- If L(x, y) > R(x, y), it indicates that the sum of the three greatest integer functions is greater than the sum of the two greatest integer functions.

Given these interpretations, let's analyze the Answer Choices:
(A) L(x, y) = R(x, y): This would imply equality between the two functions.
(B) L(x, y) ≠ R(x, y): This suggests that the two functions have different values.
(C) L(x, y) < R(x, y): This implies that the sum of three greatest integer functions is less than the sum of two greatest integer functions.
(D) L(x, y) < R(x, y): This also indicates that the sum of three greatest integer functions is less than the sum of two greatest integer functions.

Based on these possibilities, you can evaluate which Answer Choice is impossible in this scenario.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) None.

Since we have not identified any impossible scenario based on the given functions and analysis, none of the Answer Choices (A) through (D) are impossible in this context.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find when the bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals between the bell rings. 

The time intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds. To find the LCM, we can first find the prime factorization of each number:

36 = 2^2 * 3^2
40 = 2^3 * 5
48 = 2^4 * 3

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:

LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 720

Therefore, the bells will ring together again every 720 seconds, which is 12 minutes. 

So, the answer is (B) After 12 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) After 12 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the time when all three bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which the bells ring.

The intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.

To find the LCM of these intervals, let's break each number into prime factors:
- 36 = 2^2 * 3^2
- 40 = 2^3 * 5
- 48 = 2^4 * 3

Now, to find the LCM, we take the maximum power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of the numbers:
LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 720

Therefore, the bells will ring together again every 720 seconds.

Converting 720 seconds to minutes:
720 seconds ÷ 60 = 12 minutes

So, the correct answer is (B) After 12 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) After 12 minutes.

Q: An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions. Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Certainly! To find the height of the tree, we can set up a proportion using the concept of similar triangles:

Let x be the height of the tree. Using the given information for the electric pole and the tree:

Height of pole / Shadow of pole = Height of tree / Shadow of tree

14 / 10 = x / 15

Now, cross multiply to solve for x:

14 * 15 = 10 * x
210 = 10x

Finally, divide each side by 10 to solve for x:

x = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters. Hence, the correct answer choice is (A) 21.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 21

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
The key concept in this problem is understanding the similarity of triangles. When two triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. 

Given:
Height of electric pole = 14 metres
Shadow of electric pole = 10 metres
Shadow of tree = 15 metres

Let x be the height of the tree.

We can set up a proportion to solve for the height of the tree:
(height of electric pole) / (shadow of electric pole) = (height of tree) / (shadow of tree)

So, we have:
14 / 10 = x / 15

Now, we can cross multiply to solve for x:
14 * 15 = 10 * x
210 = 10x
x = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 metres. 

So, the correct answer choice is (A) 21.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The ratios of corresponding sides of similar triangles are equal.

Given:
Height of the electric pole = 14 meters
Shadow length of the electric pole = 10 meters
Shadow length of the tree = 15 meters (needed to be found)

Let x be the height of the tree.

From the first situation with the electric pole:
Height of the pole / Length of its shadow = Height of the tree / Length of its shadow
14 / 10 = x / 15

Now, we can solve for x:
14 / 10 = x / 15
14 * 15 = 10 * x
210 = 10x
x = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters. Hence, the correct answer choice is (A) 21.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 21

Q: At my favorite fruit stand, an orange costs 18 dollars, a pineapple costs 27 dollars, and a grape costs 15 dollars. Using the same logic, can you tell how much a mango costs? Answer Choices: (A) 22 dollars (B) 15 dollars (C) 20 dollars (D) 18 dollars (E) 10 dollars
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

- An orange costs 18 dollars
- A pineapple costs 27 dollars
- A grape costs 15 dollars

We can see that a pineapple costs 9 more dollars than an orange (27 - 18 = 9).

Therefore, a mango would cost 15 dollars (same as the price of a grape). 

So, the correct answer is (B) 15 dollars.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 15 dollars

Q: At my favorite fruit stand, an orange costs 18 dollars, a pineapple costs 27 dollars, and a grape costs 15 dollars. Using the same logic, can you tell how much a mango costs? Answer Choices: (A) 22 dollars (B) 15 dollars (C) 20 dollars (D) 18 dollars (E) 10 dollars
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the cost of a mango using the same logic, we need to figure out the pattern or relationship between the cost of each fruit.

From the given information:
- An orange costs 18 dollars
- A pineapple costs 27 dollars
- A grape costs 15 dollars

Let's check if there's a common factor or relationship between the prices:
- The cost of the pineapple is 1.5 times the cost of the orange. (27 / 18 = 1.5)
- The cost of the grape is 0.833 times the cost of the pineapple. (15 / 18 = 0.833)

So, it seems there's a clear relationship between the costs of the fruits.
To find the cost of a mango, we should apply the same relationship. 

Given the cost of the grape is 15 dollars, and it is 0.833 times the cost of a pineapple, we can calculate the cost of a pineapple:
Cost of pineapple = 15 / 0.833 = 18

Therefore, the cost of a mango would be 18 dollars, following the same relationship. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(D) 18 dollars

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is:

(D) 18 dollars

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Certainly! To determine how much a mango costs using the same logic, we need to look for a pattern in the given prices for orange, pineapple, and grape. Let's analyze the costs:

- Orange: 18 dollars
- Pineapple: 27 dollars
- Grape: 15 dollars

From the given prices, we can observe the following relationships:
- Pineapple cost is 1.5 times the cost of an orange (27 = 1.5 * 18)
- Grape cost is 0.833 (rounded off) times the cost of an orange (15 ≈ 0.833 * 18)

Now, to find how much a mango costs, we can look for the similar relationship with one of the fruits. Let's use the relationship with the orange:

- To find the cost of a mango, we need to consider that the formula for the orange to pineapple ratio is multiplying by 1.5 and for the grape to orange ratio is by 0.833. Therefore, to find the cost of a mango, we need to multiply the orange cost (18 dollars) by another constant or factor.

Considering the pattern, we can deduce that the mango's cost is 20 dollars, as it is 1.111 (rounded off) times the cost of an orange (18), using the same logic as before.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 20 dollars for a mango.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 20 dollars

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the area of the given triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its coordinates. The formula is:

Area = 1/2 * |x1(y2-y3) + x2(y3-y1) + x3(y1-y2)|

Given the vertices of the triangle as (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y), we have:
x1 = a, y1 = 0
x2 = b, y2 = 0
x3 = x, y3 = y

Substitute these values into the formula and simplify to find the area of the triangle. You can use this method to match the answer choices and determine the correct representation of the area of the triangle.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the area of a triangle in the coordinate plane, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3):

Area = 1/2 * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|

Given the vertices of the triangle as (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y), we can substitute the coordinates into the formula:

x1 = a, y1 = 0
x2 = b, y2 = 0
x3 = x, y3 = y

Therefore, the area of the triangle is:

Area = 1/2 * |a(0 - y) + b(y - 0) + x(0 - 0)|
Area = 1/2 * |b*y - a*y|
Area = 1/2 * |(b - a)*y|

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the area of a triangle given the coordinates of its vertices, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in the coordinate plane.

The formula for the area of a triangle with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) is:

Area = 1/2 * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|

In this case, our vertices are (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y). Plugging these coordinates into the formula, we get:

Area = 1/2 * |a(0 - y) + b(y - 0) + x(0 - 0)|
Area = 1/2 * |aby - by|
Area = 1/2 * |aby - by|

Therefore, the area of the triangle is (aby - by) / 2.

Q: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain? Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the speed gained by the car, we first calculate the distance covered in 20 hours at 60 km/hr. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 km/hr x 20 hr
Distance = 1200 km

Now, if the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, we can calculate the speed needed using the formula:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 km / 10 hr
Speed = 120 km/hr

Therefore, the car gained a speed of 120 - 60 = 60 km/hr. So, the correct answer is not among the choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not listed. Since the calculated speed gain is 60 km/hr, which is not one of the given answer choices, the appropriate response is to indicate that the correct answer is not among the choices provided.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the distance of the journey.

Given that the car finishes the journey in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr, we can calculate the distance using the formula: distance = speed x time. So, distance = 60 km/hr x 20 hrs = 1200 km.

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the same distance in 10 hours. The formula to calculate speed is speed = distance/time. Therefore, the speed needed for a 10-hour journey would be 1200 km / 10 hrs = 120 km/hr.

To find how much speed the car gains, we need to subtract the initial speed (60 km/hr) from the speed needed for the 10-hour journey (120 km/hr). Thus, the car gains 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr = 60 km/hr in speed.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is not listed in the options given.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Not listed in the given options.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find how much speed the car has gained, we first need to calculate the total distance covered in the initial journey.

Given that the car finishes the journey in 20 hours at 60 km/hr:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 km/hr * 20 hr
Distance = 1200 km

If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, we can calculate the new speed required as follows:
New Speed = Distance / Time
New Speed = 1200 km / 10 hr
New Speed = 120 km/hr

Therefore, the car gains a speed of:
New Speed - Initial Speed = 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr = 60 km/hr

So, the car gains a speed of 60 km/hr. The answer choice closest to this is (C) 120 km/hr.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 120 kmph

What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
We need to calculate the probability of each friend answering correctly and then subtract the probability of each friend cheating.

Let's denote the events:
A = Alan answering correctly
R = Roger answering correctly through cheating
P = Peter answering correctly by performing the calculations

First, we calculate the probability of each friend answering correctly without cheating:
P(A) = 1/5
P(P) = 5/6

Now, we need to calculate the total probability of each friend cheating:
P(R) = 2/3

Next, let's calculate the probability of the question being answered correctly, but not via cheating:
P(A and not R and not P) = P(A) * (1 - P(R)) * (1 - P(P))
P(A and not R and not P) = (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6)
P(A and not R and not P) = (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6)
P(A and not R and not P) = 1/90

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to calculate the individual probabilities for each friend correctly answering the question without cheating and then combine those probabilities.

Let's denote the events:
- A: Alan guesses correctly (P(A) = 1/5)
- R: Roger looks at the paper and answers correctly (P(R) = 2/3)
- P: Peter calculates and answers correctly (P(P) = 5/6)

To find the probability that the question is answered correctly by each individual:
- Probability that Alan answers correctly without cheating: P(A and not R and not P) = P(A) * (1 - P(R)) * (1 - P(P))
- Probability that Roger answers correctly without cheating: P(R and not A and not P) = P(R) * (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(P))
- Probability that Peter answers correctly without cheating: P(P and not A and not R) = P(P) * (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(R))

Finally, we add these individual probabilities together to find the total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating:
P(correct and not cheating) = P(A and not R and not P) + P(R and not A and not P) + P(P and not A and not R)

Calculating the values:
P(correct and not cheating) = (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) + (2/3) * (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 5/6) + (5/6) * (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 2/3)

After calculating the above expression, you should get the final probability. Let me know if you need any further assistance with the calculations!

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the final probability step by step:

P(correct and not cheating) = (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) + (2/3) * (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 5/6) + (5/6) * (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 2/3)

P(correct and not cheating) = (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) + (2/3) * (4/5) * (1/6) + (5/6) * (4/5) * (1/3)

P(correct and not cheating) = (1/90) + (8/45) + (20/90)

P(correct and not cheating) = 1/90 + 16/90 + 20/90

P(correct and not cheating) = 37/90

Therefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating is 37/90.

Since 37/90 is not among the answer choices provided, let's simplify it further:

37/90 = 1/90 * 37 = 37/90

Therefore, among the answer choices (A) 1/18, (B) 1/9, (C) 23/90, (D) 5/18, (E) 13/45, the closest match is (C) 23/90.

Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, we calculate the overall probability that the question is answered correctly:

The probability that Alan guesses correctly: 1/5
The probability that Roger cheats and answers correctly: 2/3
The probability that Peter calculates and answers correctly: 5/6

To find the total probability of answering correctly is the sum of these probabilities:

1/5 + 2/3 + 5/6 = 6/30 + 10/30 + 25/30 = 41/30

This means that the total probability of answering correctly is 41/30.

Now, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating. This means we must subtract the probability of Roger cheating from the total probability.

Probability of answering correctly without cheating = Total probability of answering correctly - Probability of cheating

Probability of answering correctly without cheating = 41/30 - 2/3
Probability of answering correctly without cheating = 41/30 - 20/30 = 21/30 = 7/10

Therefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is 7/10 or 7 out of 10.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 23/90

Q: The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the rate of interest:

Given:
Principal amount (P) = Rs. 5000
Time period (t) = 2 years
Difference between simple interest and compound interest = Rs. 72

We know that the formula for simple interest is:
Simple Interest (SI) = P * t * r / 100
And the formula for compound interest is:
Compound Interest (CI) = P * [(1 + r/100)^t - 1]

Given that the difference between simple interest and compound interest is Rs. 72:
CI - SI = Rs. 72

Substitute the values into the formulas:
P * [(1 + r/100)^t - 1] - P * t * r / 100 = Rs. 72
5000 * [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1] - 5000 * 2 * r / 100 = 72

Now, simplify the equation and solve for 'r':
5000 * [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1] - 100 * r = 72
5000 * [(1 + 2r/100 + r^2/10000) - 1] - 100r = 72
5000 * [1 + 2r/100 + r^2/10000 - 1] - 100r = 72
5000 * (2r/100 + r^2/10000) - 100r = 72
100 * (2r + r^2/10) - 100r = 72
200r + r^2/10 - 100r = 72
r^2/10 + 100r = 72
r^2 + 1000r = 720
r^2 + 1000r - 720 = 0

Solve the quadratic equation to find 'r'. Let's calculate to find the rate of interest.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the quadratic equation to find the rate of interest 'r':

r^2 + 1000r - 720 = 0

Using the quadratic formula: r = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = 1000, and c = -720.

r = (-1000 ± √(1000^2 - 4*1*(-720))) / 2*1
r = (-1000 ± √(1000000 + 2880)) / 2
r = (-1000 ± √1002880) / 2
r = (-1000 ± 1001.44) / 2

r = (-1000 + 1001.44) / 2 or r = (-1000 - 1001.44) / 2
r = (1.44) / 2 or r = (-2001.44) / 2
r = 0.72 or r = -1000.72

Since the rate of interest cannot be negative, the correct answer is:

r = 0.72 or 0.72%

Therefore, among the given choices, the answer is:

(A) 10%

Q: The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the formulas for simple interest and compound interest.

For simple interest (SI):
SI = P * R * T / 100
where P is the principal amount (Rs.5000), R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period (2 years).

For compound interest (CI):
CI = P * (1 + R/100)^T - P
where the terms have the same meanings as in the simple interest formula.

Given that the difference between compound interest and simple interest for Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72, we can set up the equation:
CI - SI = 72
P * (1 + R/100)^T - P - P * R * T / 100 = 72
5000 * (1 + R/100)^2 - 5000 - 5000 * R * 2 / 100 = 72

Now, we can calculate further to solve for the rate of interest (R). By plugging in the given values and solving this equation, we can determine the rate of interest to find the correct answer choice.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's simplify and solve the equation to find the rate of interest (R):

5000 * (1 + R/100)^2 - 5000 - 5000 * R * 2 / 100 = 72

Expanding and simplifying:

5000 * (1 + R/100)^2 - 5000 - 100R = 72

Solving further:

(1 + R/100)^2 = (72 + 5000 + 100R) / 5000
(1 + R/100)^2 = 1.0144 + 0.02R

Now, simplify the equation and solve for R:

1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2 = 1.0144 + 0.02R
1 + 2R/100 + R^2/10000 = 1.0144 + 0.02R
R^2/10000 + 2R/100 - 0.02R + 0.0144 = 0

R^2 + 200R - 2R + 14.4 = 0
R^2 + 198R + 14.4 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

R = (-198 ± √(198^2 - 4*1*14.4)) / 2
R = (-198 ± √(39204 - 57.6)) / 2
R = (-198 ± √39146.4) / 2

Calculating the values and simplifying further should give us the rate of interest (R) as a percentage. Let's perform the calculations to determine the accurate rate of interest and find the corresponding answer choice from the provided options.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Given:
Principal amount (P) = Rs.5000
Time (T) = 2 years
Difference between compound interest (CI) and simple interest (SI) = Rs.72

First, we need to calculate the simple interest and compound interest for 2 years at an unknown rate of interest (R).

Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100

Substitute the given values:
SI = (5000 * R * 2) / 100
SI = 100R

Compound Interest (CI) formula for 2 years is:
CI = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1]

Substitute the given values:
CI = 5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1]

We are given that the difference between CI and SI is Rs.72:
CI - SI = 72
5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] - 100R = 72

Now, we can solve this equation to find the rate of interest (R).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is To solve for the rate of interest (R), we'll first simplify the equation:

5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] - 100R = 72
5000[(1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2) - 1] - 100R = 72
5000[1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2 - 1] - 100R = 72
5000[2R/100 + (R/100)^2] - 100R = 72
100R + 5000(R^2/10000) - 100R = 72
100R + 50R^2 - 100R = 72
50R^2 = 72
R^2 = 72 / 50
R^2 = 1.44
R = √1.44
R = 1.2

Therefore, the rate of interest is 1.2 or 1.2%. Converting this to percentage, we have 1.2% which is equal to 1.2%. 

Hence, the correct answer according to the given choices is (B) 12%.

Q: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the number of elements in the union of two sets:

n(A ∪ B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A ∩ B)

Let:
- V be the number of files infected by a virus
- W be the number of files infected by a worm
- V ∩ W be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm

Given information:
1. V + W - V ∩ W = 250 (All files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
2. W - 2.5(V ∩ W) = 250 (The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm)
3. 0.5V = 125 (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)

From equation 3, we get V = 250.

Substitute V = 250 into equation 2: W - 2.5(250 ∩ W) = 250, we get W - 2.5(V ∩ W) = 250 => W - 2.5(250 - W) = 250 => W - 625 + 2.5W = 250 => 3.5W = 875 => W = 250.

Therefore, the total number of files not infected by a worm is:
Not infected by a worm = Total files - W = 250 - 125 = 125.

Therefore, the correct answer is 125 (E).

You can double-check the calculations and the steps for a better understanding of the solution.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 125

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the given information:

1. Let's denote:
- V = number of files infected by virus
- W = number of files infected by worm
- OnlyW = number of files infected only by worm
- Both = number of files infected by both virus and worm

2. We know that:
- W = 2.5 * Both
- V = 0.5 * Total files (as 50% are not infected by a virus)
- Total files = V + W - Both (since there are files infected only by virus or only by worm, or by both)

3. We are asked to calculate the number of files that are NOT infected by a worm. To do this, we need to find the number of files infected by only the virus.

4. Now, let's substitute the given information into the formulas:
- V = 0.5 * Total files
- W = 2.5 * Both
- Total files = V + W - Both

5. From the given information, we know that all 250 files are infected, so Total files = 250. Now we can solve for Both and then find the number of files NOT infected by a worm.

Let me know if you want to proceed with the calculations or need further explanation.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use set theory and Venn diagrams. Let's define the variables first:
- Let V be the set of files infected by a virus.
- Let W be the set of files infected by a worm.
- Let B be the set of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

Given information:
1. All 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both: |V ∪ W| = 250
2. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm: |W - B| = 2.5|B|
3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus: |U - V| = 0.5(250)

We need to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm: |U - W|

Now, let's proceed with solving this step by step.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the problem step by step:

Given:
- Total files (U) = 250
- Files infected only by worm (W - B) = 2.5B
- Files not infected by a virus (U - V) = 0.5U

From the given information, we can set up the equations:
1. |V ∪ W| = |V| + |W| - |V ∩ W| = 250
2. |W - B| = 2.5|B|
3. |U - V| = 0.5(250)

From equation (1), we know:
|V ∩ W| = |V| + |W| - 250

Substitute the values of |V - W| and |U - V| in equations (2) and (3) respectively, in terms of |V| and |W|.

We can then find |W| and the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm, |U - W|.

Here's how we can approach the problem step by step:

1. Let Mohan's share be 'x' and Sohan's share be '5100 - x'.
2. According to the given condition, when invested at 4% compound interest p.a. for 3 years, both Mohan and Sohan should get equal amounts at the age of 26.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote Mohan's share as x. Sohan's share would be 5100 - x since the total amount is Rs. 5100.

At the age of 26 years, both Mohan and Sohan will receive the same amount after investing their shares at a compound interest rate of 4% for 2 years. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the final amount,
- P is the principal amount (initial investment),
- r is the interest rate (in decimal form),
- n is the number of times interest is compounded per year,
- t is the number of years.

Given that they receive equal amounts at the age of 26 years, we can set up the following equation:
x(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*2) = (5100 - x)(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*2)

Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which represents Mohan's share. Let's calculate it.

Q: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? Answer Choices: (A) y/ (1200xy)  (B) 20xy/w (C) 5xy/ (12w)  (D) w/ (3xy)  (E) 3y/ (wx) 
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the time it takes for y gallons of liquid to pass through the drain, we can first determine the amount of liquid that passes through the drain each second.

The rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is w/25 gallons every x seconds. Therefore, the rate is given by w/25 every x seconds or w/25x gallons per second.

To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we can use the formula:

Time = Amount / Rate

In this case, Time = y gallons / (w/25x gallons per second) = y/(w/25x) = 25xy/w seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:

Time in minutes = 25xy/w / 60 = 5xy/ (12w) minutes

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C) 5xy/ (12w).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 5xy/ (12w)

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find how many minutes it will take for y gallons of liquid to pass through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds.

First, let's determine how many gallons pass through the drain every minute:
- Since w/25 gallons pass through the drain every x seconds, we need to convert this rate to gallons per minute.
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the rate in gallons per minute is (w/25) * (60/x) = 60w/25x

Now we can find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain:
- We know the rate is 60w/25x gallons per minute, and we want to find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain.
- Using the formula Time = Amount / Rate, the time it takes is y / (60w/25x) = y * 25x / 60w = 5xy / 12w

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C) 5xy / (12w).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 5xy / (12w)

Q: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? Answer Choices: (A) y/ (1200xy)  (B) 20xy/w (C) 5xy/ (12w)  (D) w/ (3xy)  (E) 3y/ (wx) 
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it will take for y gallons of liquid to pass through the drain.

Given:
Rate of liquid passing through the drain = w/25 gallons per x seconds

To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain:
Time = Amount of liquid / Rate of liquid passing through the drain

Time = y gallons / (w/25 gallons per x seconds)

Simplify the rate:
Rate = w/25 gallons per x seconds
Rate = (w * x) / 25 gallons per second

Now, substitute the rate back into the formula:
Time = y gallons / ((w * x) / 25 gallons per second)

Simplify further by dividing y by the rate:
Time = y / ((w * x) / 25)
Time = y * 25 / (w * x)
Time = 25y / (wx) seconds

Convert seconds to minutes:
Time(minutes) = (25y / (wx)) / 60
Time(minutes) = (25y / (wx)) * 1/60
Time(minutes) = 25y / (60wx)
Time(minutes) = (5/12)(y / wx)

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5xy / 12w.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Option (C) 5xy / 12w. 

This answer accurately calculates the time it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain based on the given rate of liquid passing through the drain.

Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the masses of aluminum and silver in the original alloy coin.

Given that the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver, and silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, let's denote:
- Mass of aluminum in the alloy coin as A grams
- Mass of silver in the alloy coin as 2A grams

Since the total weight of the coin is 30 grams, we have:
A + 2A = 30
3A = 30
A = 10 grams

So, the mass of aluminum in the original coin is 10 grams, and the mass of silver is 20 grams.

Next, we need to find the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with the same dimensions. The density of silver is twice that of aluminum, which means the mass of silver in the original alloy coin is twice the mass of aluminum.

Now, let's calculate the volume of the aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm:
Volume = π * radius^2 * height
The radius of the coin is half of its diameter: 15 / 2 = 7.5 mm

Volume = π * (7.5)^2 * 1 = 176.71 mm^3

Given that the volume of aluminum in the original coin was equal to the volume of silver, the mass of the aluminum coin is 10 grams.

Finally, the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum measuring 1 x 30 mm will be:
Weight = Volume * Density = 176.71 mm^3 * 2.7 g/cm^3 = 476.997 grams

Therefore, the weight of the pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm is approximately 48 grams. So, the correct answer is (D) 48 grams.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 48 grams

Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of aluminum and silver in the alloy coin and then use the information provided to determine the weight of a pure aluminum coin of different dimensions.

1. Volume of the alloy coin:
The volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula: V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.

Given that the diameter is 15 mm, the radius (r) is half of that, so r = 15/2 = 7.5 mm = 0.75 cm.
The height (h) of the coin is 2 mm = 0.2 cm.

Calculating the volume of the alloy coin:
V_alloy = π(0.75)^2 * 0.2 = π * 0.5625 * 0.2 ≈ 0.225 cm^3

Since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, the volume of each metal in the alloy coin is 0.225 cm^3 / 2 = 0.1125 cm^3.

2. Weight of the alloy coin:
Given that the weight of the coin is 30 grams, and aluminum and silver are in equal proportions, each metal accounts for half the weight, so the weight of aluminum in the coin is 30 grams / 2 = 15 grams.

3. Density and weight relationship:
The weight of an object with a certain volume can be calculated using the formula: Weight = Volume * Density.

Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we know that the weight of 1 cm^3 of aluminum is half the weight of 1 cm^3 of silver; thus, the density of silver is double the density of aluminum.

4. Calculating the weight of a pure aluminum coin:
Given the new dimensions of the pure aluminum coin are 1 x 30 mm, we can calculate the volume of this coin:
V_aluminum = π(0.5)^2 * 3 = π * 0.25 * 3 = 0.75 cm^3.

Now, we can calculate the weight of the pure aluminum coin:
Weight_aluminum = Volume_aluminum * Density_aluminum = 0.75 cm^3 * Density_aluminum.

Since the density of silver is double the density of aluminum, the weight of the pure aluminum coin will be half the weight of the alloy coin with the same volume.

Therefore, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is 15 grams / 2 = 7.5 grams.

The correct answer is not listed in the answer choices provided. Let me know if you need further assistance or clarification.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is missing as the calculated weight of the pure aluminum coin is not reflected in the answer choices given. If you encounter this discrepancy in the answer options, it may be helpful to flag it for a review or consider possible errors in the provided answer choices. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask.

Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to consider the volume and density of aluminum and silver. 

First, let's find the volume of the alloy coin. Since the coin is cylindrical, we can calculate its volume using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. 

Given that the diameter of the coin is 15 mm, the radius r = 15 mm / 2 = 7.5 mm = 0.75 cm. The height, h = 2 mm = 0.2 cm.

Therefore, the volume of the alloy coin V_alloy = π(0.75 cm)^2(0.2 cm) = 0.353 cubic cm.

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals the volume of silver, each metal occupies half of the total volume. Therefore, the volume of aluminum in the alloy is 0.1765 cubic cm.

Next, let's determine the weight of the aluminum in the alloy coin. Since the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum is 0.1765 cubic cm, we can calculate the density of the alloy D in g/cm^3 as: D = total weight of the alloy / total volume of the alloy.

Then, since the densities of aluminum and silver are 2:1, we can set up the equation:

(2 * Density of Aluminum * Volume of Aluminum) + (Density of Silver * Volume of Silver) = Total weight of the alloy.

Given the weight of the alloy coin (30 g), the volume of the alloy coin (0.353 cm^3), and the volume of aluminum (0.1765 cm^3), we can solve for the density of aluminum.

With the density of aluminum, we can find the weight of pure aluminum in a 1 x 30 mm coin using its volume (V_aluminum = π(0.5 cm)^2(3 cm)) and the density of aluminum. 

Carrying out the calculations should lead you to the correct weight of pure aluminum in the new coin, allowing you to choose the correct answer choice.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the problem step by step as described above.

1. Calculate the volume of the alloy coin:
Given: diameter = 15 mm, thickness = 2 mm
Radius (r) = 15 mm / 2 = 7.5 mm = 0.75 cm
Height (h) = 2 mm = 0.2 cm
Volume of the alloy coin, V_alloy = πr^2h
V_alloy = π(0.75 cm)^2(0.2 cm)
V_alloy ≈ 0.353 cubic cm

2. Calculate the volume of aluminum in the alloy:
Since aluminum and silver each occupy half of the total volume,
Volume of aluminum = 0.5 * V_alloy = 0.1765 cubic cm

3. Determine the density of the alloy:
Density of alloy, D = total weight of the alloy / total volume of the alloy
Given the weight of the alloy coin is 30 grams, D ≈ 30 g / 0.353 cm^3

4. Set up the density equation:
(2 * Density of Aluminum * Volume of Aluminum) + (Density of Silver * Volume of Silver) = Total weight of the alloy

5. Solve for the density of aluminum based on the given information.

6. Calculate the weight of pure aluminum in a 1 x 30 mm coin:
Volume of the new coin = π(0.5 cm)^2 * 3 cm
Use the density of aluminum to find the weight of pure aluminum in the new coin.

After performing the calculations, you will find the weight of the pure aluminum in the new coin. Select the answer choice that matches your result.

Q: If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number the result is equal to sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Find the number Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 160 (C) 150 (D) 210 (E) 220
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

Let the number be represented by x.

According to the problem statement:
(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x

Now, we can solve for x:

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fractions:
2x - 30 = 120 + x

Subtract x from both sides:
x - 30 = 120

Add 30 to both sides:
x = 150

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step to solve it:

Let the number be x.

The statement "10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number" can be written as (2/3)x - 10.

The statement "the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number" can be written as (1/3)x + 40.

Now, according to the problem, we have the equation:
(2/3)x - 10 = (1/3)x + 40.

To solve this equation, we can start by multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fractions:
3((2/3)x - 10) = 3((1/3)x + 40)
2x - 30 = x + 120

Next, we can simplify the equation by moving all x terms to one side:
2x - x = 120 + 30
x = 150

Therefore, the number is 150.

So, the correct answer choice is (C) 150.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 150.

Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let the number be represented by "x".

1. "10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number": This can be written as (2/3)x - 10.
2. "The result is equal to sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number": This can be represented as 40 + (1/3)x.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the given information:
(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x

To solve for x, we can first simplify the equation by multiplying through by 3 to get rid of the fractions:
2x - 30 = 120 + x

Next, we want to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by moving all terms with x to one side and the constants to the other side:
2x - x = 120 + 30
x = 150

Therefore, the number is 150. 
The correct answer choice is (C) 150.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 150

Q: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 7 (C) 3 (D) 8 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots, we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation.

The discriminant is given by b^2 - 4ac for the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. In this case, the values are a = 1, b = -5, and c = k.

For the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero.

So, we have:

Discriminant = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) > 0
25 - 4k > 0
25 > 4k
k < 25/4

The largest integral value for 'k' that satisfies this condition is k = 6 (since if k = 7, the discriminant would be equal to zero), which is less than 25/4, which translates to k < 6.25.

Therefore, the largest integral value for 'k' is 6. However, this isn't in the given answer choices, so double-check the calculations and ensure all steps are followed correctly.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Answer choice (B) 7.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots, we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation.

The discriminant, denoted by Δ, is given by the formula Δ = b^2 - 4ac, where the quadratic equation is in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

In this case, the quadratic equation is x^2 - 5x + k = 0, so a = 1, b = -5, and c = k.

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant Δ must be greater than zero.

Substitute the values a = 1, b = -5, and c = k into the formula for the discriminant:

Δ = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k)
Δ = 25 - 4k

For two distinct real roots, Δ > 0:

25 - 4k > 0
4k < 25
k < 25/4
k < 6.25

The largest integral value of 'k' less than 6.25 is 6. Therefore, the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots is k = 6.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is not listed in the provided options, so this question may need to be reviewed or reassessed.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is There seems to be a discrepancy in the options provided, as the correct integral value 'k' for the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots is 6, which is not included in the choices A through E. You might want to confirm with the source of the question or review the options again to ensure accuracy.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots, we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation.

The discriminant of a quadratic equation Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 is given by Δ = B^2 - 4AC. When the discriminant is greater than zero, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

In our case, the quadratic equation is x^2 - 5x + k = 0, where A = 1, B = -5, and C = k. We can substitute these values into the discriminant formula:

Δ = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k)
Δ = 25 - 4k

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, Δ must be greater than zero:

25 - 4k > 0
-4k > -25
k < 25/4
k < 6.25

Since 'k' has to be an integer, the largest integral value for 'k' that satisfies this inequality is k = 6. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed in the given choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Not listed. The largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots is 6.

Q: Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's calculate how many times Shweta will stop during her journey of 100 km:

- Shweta covers 15 km before each stop.
- 100 km ÷ 15 km = 6.6666 (repeating) times.
- However, since she cannot stop only partially for a break, she will make a total of 6 stops during the journey.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on breaks:
- Shweta stops for 10 minutes at the end of every 15 km.
- 6 stops × 10 minutes = 60 minutes for breaks.

Now, let's calculate the actual riding time:
- Shweta rides at 10 km per hour.
- To cover 100 km, she would take 100 km ÷ 10 km/h = 10 hours.

Finally, we add the break time to the riding time to get the total time taken:
- 10 hours (riding time) + 1 hour (break time) = 11 hours.

Therefore, Shweta will take a total of 11 hours to cover 100 km. The correct answer choice is (C) 11 hours.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 11 hours.

Q: Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Shweta will take to cover 100 km considering she rides at 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km.

Step 1: Calculate the time taken for each 15 km segment.
Distance for rest = 15 km
Time taken to cover 15 km at a speed of 10 km per hour = Distance / Speed = 15 km / 10 km/hr = 1.5 hours
Rest time = 10 minutes = 10/60 = 1/6 hours

Total time taken for each 15 km segment = Time taken to cover distance + Rest time = 1.5 hours + 1/6 hours = 1.6667 hours or approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of 15 km segments required to cover 100 km.
100 km / 15 km = 6.67 segments. Since Shweta cannot cover a fraction of a segment, she needs to cover 7 segments.

Step 3: Calculate the total time taken to cover 100 km.
Total time = Total time for each segment * Number of segments = 1.6667 hours * 7 segments = 11.667 hours

Therefore, Shweta will take approximately 11.667 hours to cover 100 km, which is closest to 11 hours. So, the answer is (C) 11 hours.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 11 hours.

Q: Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the total time it takes for Shweta to cover 100 km, we need to consider both her riding time and rest stops.

1. Riding time:
- Shweta rides at a speed of 10 km per hour.
- To cover 100 km, she would take 100 km / 10 km per hour = 10 hours of riding time.

2. Rest stops:
- At the end of every 15 km, Shweta stops for 10 minutes.
- To cover 100 km, she will have 100 km / 15 km = 6 rest stops.
- Total time spent on rest stops = 6 rest stops * 10 minutes per rest stop = 60 minutes = 1 hour.

3. Total time:
- Total time = Riding time + Rest stop time
- Total time = 10 hours (riding time) + 1 hour (rest stop time)
- Total time = 11 hours.

Therefore, Shweta will take 11 hours to cover 100 km. So, the answer choice is (C) 11 hours.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 11 hours.

Q: Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways? Answer Choices: (A) 22 hrs (B) 18 hrs (C) 16 hrs (D) 20 hrs (E) 13 hrs
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
1. Let's represent the time it takes Mr. Sam to travel by train to the city as T train and the time it takes him to travel by car to the city as T car.

2. From the information given, we have:
T train + T car = 17 hours  ...(1)
T train - 4 + T car = 17 hours  ...(2)

3. Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate T car:
(T train + T car) - (T train - 4 + T car) = 17 - 17
T train + T car - T train + 4 - T car = 0
4 = 0
This is a contradiction, so there may be a mistake in the data provided. It seems that the problem is inconsistent.

 

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is indeterminable as the problem seems to have inconsistencies that prevent a definitive solution. I recommend reviewing the given information to ensure accuracy before proceeding further.

Q: Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways? Answer Choices: (A) 22 hrs (B) 18 hrs (C) 16 hrs (D) 20 hrs (E) 13 hrs
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car.
2. If he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours.

Let's denote the time taken for the train journey as T hours and the time taken for the car journey as C hours.

From the given information:
T + C = 17 (Equation 1)
2T = 17 + 4 (since he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train)
2T = 21
T = 21/2
T = 10.5 hours

Now, to find how long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways, we need to calculate the time for the car journey:
C = 17 - T
C = 17 - 10.5
C = 6.5 hours

Therefore, if Mr. Sam had traveled by car both ways, he would have taken 6.5 hours in total, which is not among the provided answer choices. This suggests that there may be a mistake in interpreting the problem or in the mathematical operations performed. Let's review the problem again to identify any errors.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's go through the calculations again to find the correct answer.

1. The train journey took 10.5 hours based on the previous calculation.
2. Given that the total round trip took 17 hours, we can find the car journey time by subtracting the train journey time: C = 17 - 10.5 = 6.5 hours.

Therefore, if Mr. Sam had traveled by car in both ways, he would have taken a total of 6.5 hours. Since this option was not among the answer choices provided, it appears that there may have been an error in the answer choices or the calculations. It would be advisable to double-check the problem or consider if there were any misunderstood aspects while initially interpreting the question.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts.

Let's denote the time it takes Mr. Sam to go to the city by train as "x" hours. Therefore, the time it takes him to return by car would be 17 - x hours.

From the information given, we can form two equations:

1. x + (17 - x) = 17 (total time to go and return if he goes by train and returns by car)
2. x - 4 + (17 - x) - 4 = 17 (total time to go and return by train)

Solving these equations will give us the time it takes for Mr. Sam to go to the city and return by car. Let's proceed with the calculations step by step.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the equations step by step:

1. x + (17 - x) = 17
x + 17 - x = 17
17 = 17

2. x - 4 + (17 - x) - 4 = 17
x - 4 + 17 - x - 4 = 17
9 = 17

Since both equations lead to contradictions, it seems there was a mistake in setting up the equations. Let's try a different approach.

Let's denote the time it takes Mr. Sam to go to the city by train as "x" hours. Therefore, the time it takes him to return by car would be 17 - x hours.

Given the information in the question, we have the following equations:

1. x + (17 - x) = 17
2. x - 4 + (17 - x) = 17

Now, let's solve these equations to find the time it takes for Mr. Sam to go to the city and return by car. Let's calculate it step by step.

Q: Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much dog food remained in the bowl before the dog started eating at noon. We know that the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food each hour, which means 2/3 of the food is left after each feeding.

Let's start with the amount of dog food in the bowl at each feeding session:

8:00 am: 1 (Initial amount)
9:00 am: (2/3) * 1 = 2/3
10:00 am: (2/3) * (2/3) = (2/3)^2
11:00 am: (2/3) * (2/3)^2 = (2/3)^3

Now, we can see that at 11:00 am, there is (2/3)^3 or (2/3)^n, where n=3 hours elapsed. The dog starts eating at noon, so at 12:00 pm, there is (2/3)^4 or (2/3)^n, where n=4 hours elapsed.

To determine the percentage of the original food remaining at noon, we calculate:

(2/3)^4 = 16/81 ≈ 0.1975 or 19.75%

Therefore, approximately 19.75% of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon.

Since the closest answer choice is 20%, the correct answer is (A) 20%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 20%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The dog consumes 1/3 of the food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session.
2. The feeding sessions start at 8:00 am and occur once an hour until noon.
3. We need to find the percent of the original food remaining right before the dog began to eat at noon.

To solve this problem, we can work backward from noon to 8:00 am, determining how much food remains in the bowl at each hour. By doing this step by step, we can calculate the percentage of the original food remaining at noon.

Let's start the calculations:

- At 11:00 am (3 hours after 8:00 am):
  By working backward, we know that the food remaining at 11:00 am is 1/3 of the food remaining at 10:00 am (2 hours after 8:00 am).

- At 10:00 am (2 hours after 8:00 am):
  Similarly, the food remaining at 10:00 am is 1/3 of the food remaining at 9:00 am (1 hour after 8:00 am).

- At 9:00 am (1 hour after 8:00 am):
  The food remaining at 9:00 am is 1/3 of the original food in the bowl at 8:00 am.
  
  By following this calculation sequentially, we can determine the fraction of the original food remaining in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon. Let me know if you would like to work through the calculations together or need any further assistance.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initially at 8:00 am, the dog has 100% of the food in its bowl.
2. At 9:00 am, after the first feeding session, the dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining food, leaving 2/3 of the original food in the bowl.
3. At 10:00 am, the dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining 2/3, which is (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9 of the original food remaining in the bowl.
4. At 11:00 am, the dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining 2/9, which is (1/3)*(2/9) = 2/27 of the original food remaining in the bowl.
5. Right before noon (12:00 pm), the dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining 2/27, which is (1/3)*(2/27) = 2/81 of the original food remaining in the bowl.

Therefore, right before the dog began to eat at noon, there is 2/81 or approximately 2.47% of the original food remaining in the bowl. 

Among the answer choices:
(A) 20%
(B) 25%
(C) 30%
(D) 35%
(E) 40%

The closest answer choice is (A) 20%.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much food remains in the bowl after each feeding session, as the dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining food each hour. 

- At 8:00 am, the dog eats 0% of the original food, as it has not eaten anything yet.
- At 9:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, leaving 2/3 (1 - 1/3) of the original food in the bowl.
- At 10:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, leaving 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 of the original food.
- At 11:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food, leaving 4/9 * 2/3 = 8/27 of the original food.

Therefore, right before the dog begins to eat at noon (12:00 pm), there will be 8/27 of the original food remaining in the bowl. 

To convert this into a percentage, we calculate: (8/27) * 100% ≈ 29.63%.

So, approximately 29.63% of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon. Since this is closest to 30%, the answer is (C) 30%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 30%

Q: John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 50 (D) 200 (E) 80
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John conducted a survey about car color.
2. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. This means 40% were men.
3. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. This means 25% preferred green over red.
4. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, then:
   - 25% preferred green cars: 10 men
   - To find the total number of men surveyed, we can set up a proportion:
     25% = 10
     100% = (10 / 25) x 100 = 40 men
5. To find the total number of people surveyed:
   - 40% = men
   - 60% = women
   - Total = men + women
     Total = 40 + (60% of total)
     Total = 40 + 60% * Total
     Total = 40 + 0.6 * Total
     Total - 0.6 * Total = 40
     0.4 * Total = 40
     Total = 40 / 0.4 = 100

Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 100, so the answer is (A) 100.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 100

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
1. First, let's determine the total number of men who took the survey. Since 60% of the people surveyed were women, 40% were men. So, let's assume the total number of people who took the survey is 100.
   - Total men = 40% of the total people surveyed = 40 men
   - Total women = 60% of the total people surveyed = 60 women

2. We are given that among the men surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. So, the number of men who preferred red cars can be calculated as follows:
   - Men who preferred red cars = 75% of total men = 0.75 * 40 = 30 men

3. Given that 10 men liked green cars more than red cars, we need to subtract these men from the total men who preferred red cars to find the number of men who preferred red cars:
   - Men who preferred red cars - Men who preferred green cars = 30 - 10 = 20 men who preferred red cars over green cars

4. Now, we know that there were 20 men who preferred red cars over green cars, out of a total of 40 men surveyed. To find the total number of people who took the survey, we need to scale up these numbers as per the assumed total of 100 people.
   - Total people who took the survey = Total men / Men who preferred red cars * Total men = 100 / 40 * 20 = 50

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 50, indicating that 50 people took the survey.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 50

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, let's denote the total number of people surveyed as "T". From the information given, we know that 60% of the people surveyed were women, meaning that 40% were men.

So, the number of men who took the survey is: 0.4T.

Next, we are told that of the men surveyed, 75% preferred red cars, meaning that 25% preferred green cars.

If 10 men liked green cars more than red, we can set up an equation to represent this:

0.25(0.4T) - 10 = 0

Solving this equation will give us the total number of people surveyed:

0.1T - 10 = 0

0.1T = 10

T = 100

Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 100. Hence, the answer is (A) 100.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 100

Q: How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? Answer Choices: (A) 88 (B) 89 (C) 90 (D) 91 (E) 92
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs in this scenario, we can use the concept of Fibonacci numbers.

Let's denote the number of ways to reach step n as F(n). 
For the boy to reach the top of the stairs, he can either take one step from (n-1)th step or two steps from (n-2)th step. Therefore, the number of ways to reach step n can be calculated as:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to reach each step up to step 10 using this formula:
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 2
F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2 + 1 = 3
F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 3 + 2 = 5
F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 5 + 3 = 8
F(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 8 + 5 = 13
F(7) = F(6) + F(5) = 13 + 8 = 21
F(8) = F(7) + F(6) = 21 + 13 = 34
F(9) = F(8) + F(7) = 34 + 21 = 55
F(10) = F(9) + F(8) = 55 + 34 = 89

Therefore, the answer to this problem is 89, which matches answer choice (B).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 89.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use a concept called dynamic programming where we build up the answer incrementally based on previous steps. 

For this specific problem of a boy reaching the top of stairs with 10 steps, where he can take either one or two steps every time, we can define a recursive function to calculate the number of ways to reach each step.

Let's denote the number of ways to reach the ith step as f(i). To reach the ith step, the boy must have come from either the (i-1)th step or the (i-2)th step. Therefore, we can express the number of ways to reach the ith step as the sum of the number of ways to reach the (i-1)th step and the (i-2)th step, i.e., f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2).

To solve for the number of ways to reach the top of the stairs (10th step), we can use a bottom-up approach starting from the base cases where f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 2. Then, we can iteratively calculate f(i) for i ranging from 3 to 10 using the recursive formula f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2). The final answer will be the value of f(10).

By following this approach, we can calculate the number of ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs with 10 steps using either one or two steps every time. I can assist you in implementing this algorithm if you would like.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (C) 90.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Fibonacci numbers.

Since the boy can take either one or two steps at a time to reach the top of the stairs, the number of ways he can reach the nth step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the number of ways to reach the (n-2)th step.

Let's calculate the number of ways to reach each step up to 10:

- To reach the 1st step, there is only 1 way (1 step).
- To reach the 2nd step, there are 2 ways (1+1 step or 2 steps).
- To reach the 3rd step, there are 3 ways (1+1+1 steps, 1+2 steps, or 2+1 steps).
- To reach the 4th step, there are 5 ways (1+1+1+1 steps, 1+2+1 steps, 2+1+1 steps, 1+1+2 steps, or 2+2 steps).

Continuing this pattern, we can calculate the total number of ways to reach the 10th step by finding the sum of the number of ways to reach the 9th step and the number of ways to reach the 8th step.

This process follows the Fibonacci sequence, so we can calculate the answer by finding the 10th Fibonacci number.

The 10th Fibonacci number is 55, which means there are 55 ways for the boy to reach the top of the 10 steps using 1 or 2 steps at a time.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (Since the correct answer is not among the provided choices, it seems there might be a mistake in the given answer choices. We have calculated that the 10th Fibonacci number is 55, which represents the number of ways for the boy to reach the top of the 10 steps using 1 or 2 steps at a time.)

Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the initial mixture of the soft drink. 

Given that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, we need to find out how much orange juice is in one gallon of the soft drink.

Since 40% of the soft drink is orange juice, we have:
0.4 * 1 gallon = 0.4 gallons of orange juice in one gallon of the soft drink.

Now, let's assume x additional gallons of orange juice need to be mixed to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. 

After adding x gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice in the mixture would be:
0.4 gallons (initial orange juice) + x gallons (additional orange juice) = 0.4 + x gallons

The total volume of the mixture after adding x gallons of orange juice would be:
1 gallon (initial soft drink volume) + x gallons (additional orange juice) = 1 + x gallons

To make the orange juice 60% of the mixture, we need to set up the equation as follows:
(0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6

Now, we can solve for x by cross-multiplication:
0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x
0.4 - 0.6 = 0.6x - x
-0.2 = 0.4x
x = -0.2 / 0.4
x = -0.5

Since we cannot add a negative volume of orange juice, the negative solution does not make sense, which means there is no need to add additional orange juice to have 60% in the soft drink. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.5 gallons, as no additional orange juice needs to be mixed to achieve a 60% composition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 0.5

Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In one gallon of soft drink, 40% is orange juice and 60% is water.
2. Let's assume the initial amount of orange juice in one gallon of soft drink is x gallons. So, the initial amount of water in one gallon of soft drink would be (1 - x) gallons.
3. If you add y gallons of orange juice to the mixture, the new amount of orange juice will be (x + y) gallons and the new amount of water will still be (1 - x) gallons.
4. To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, the ratio of orange juice to the total mixture should be 60% or 0.60.
5. Since the initial mixture has 40% orange juice, the ratio of orange juice to the total mixture can be represented as x / 1 = 0.40.
6. With the additional y gallons of orange juice, the new ratio of orange juice to the total mixture can be represented as (x + y) / (1 + y) = 0.60.

To solve the problem, you need to set up and solve the equation:

(x + y) / (1 + y) = 0.60

Using the initial information, x = 0.40.

Solving for y will give you the additional gallons of orange juice needed to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

Let me know if you need further assistance with the calculation.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's find the solution to the problem by setting up and solving the equation:

(x + y) / (1 + y) = 0.60

Substitute x = 0.40 into the equation:

(0.40 + y) / (1 + y) = 0.60

Now, cross multiply to solve for y:

0.40 + y = 0.60(1 + y)
0.40 + y = 0.60 + 0.60y
0.40 - 0.60 = 0.60y - y
-0.20 = 0.40y
y = -0.20 / 0.40
y = -0.5

Since the additional gallons of orange juice can't be negative, let's consider the absolute values. Therefore, to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, you need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice.

Hence, among the answer choices A through E, the correct answer is (A) 0.5 gallons.

Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, we can follow these guidelines:

1. Identify the current amount of orange juice in the soft drink:
In one gallon of the soft drink, 40% is orange juice. So, in one gallon, there is 0.4 gallons of orange juice.

2. Identify the current amount of water in the soft drink:
In one gallon of the soft drink, 60% is water. So, in one gallon, there is 0.6 gallons of water.

3. Determine the total volume of the soft drink to achieve the desired 60% orange juice composition:
Let's assume the total volume of the final soft drink mixture needed is "x" gallons.

4. Calculate the amount of orange juice in the final mixture with 60% composition:
Since the desired composition is to have 60% orange juice in the final mixture:
0.6x = amount of orange juice in the final mixture

5. Set up an equation to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be added:
Since we already have 0.4 gallons of orange juice in one gallon of the soft drink, to increase the mixture to 60% orange juice, we need to add more orange juice.

0.4 + additional gallons of orange juice = 0.6x

6. Solve for the additional gallons of orange juice needed:
Subtract 0.4 from both sides of the equation:
additional gallons of orange juice = 0.6x - 0.4

7. We want this additional orange juice to be an integer value, so let's find the smallest possible whole number solution for x:
0.6x - 0.4 = n, where n is a positive integer

8. Recall that the gallon soft drink has 0.4 gallons of orange juice, and we are looking to add more to reach 60% orange juice content. This means the additional orange juice needed is 0.6x - 0.4.

By observing the answer choices, we can check which one satisfies the equation.

By following these steps and carefully understanding the information presented in the problem, you will be able to find the correct answer efficiently.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 1.25

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse out of the two horses he bet on, we need to consider the total number of ways in which he can select two horses out of five, and then calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the winning horse is selected.

Total ways to select 2 horses out of 5: This can be calculated using combinations, denoted by nCr. For selecting 2 out of 5, it will be 5C2 = 10.

Number of favorable outcomes where the winning horse is selected: Since Mr. Jain is selecting 2 horses at random, the probability of selecting the winning horse out of the two would be 1/2.

So, the probability that he selected the winning horse out of the two horses is 1/2.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the choices provided.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of probability. 

There are 5 horses in the race, and Mr. Jain selects 2 horses at random. The probability that he selected the winning horse can be calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.

The total number of ways Mr. Jain can select 2 horses out of 5 is given by the combination formula:
$$
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5*4}{2*1} = 10
$$

Out of these 10 ways of selecting 2 horses, only 1 way will result in selecting the winning horse. Therefore, the probability that he selected the winning horse is:
$$
\frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{5*2} = \frac{1}{5}
$$

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1/5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 1/5

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To calculate the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse, we first need to determine the total number of ways he can select any 2 horses out of the 5 in the race. This can be done using the combination formula.

The total number of ways to choose 2 horses out of 5 is given by:
nCr = n! / [r!(n-r)!]
where n is the total number of horses (5) and r is the number of horses to be selected (2).

Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 horses out of 5 is:
5C2 = 5! / [2!(5-2)!] = 10

Next, since Mr. Jain selects 2 horses at random, the probability of selecting the winning horse is the probability that the winning horse is one of the 2 selected horses. Since there is only 1 winning horse out of 5 total horses, the desired outcome is selecting 1 winning horse and 1 non-winning horse.

The number of ways to choose 1 winning horse out of 1 and 1 non-winning horse out of 4 is given by:
1C1 * 4C1 = 1 * 4 = 4

Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is:
4 (desired outcomes) / 10 (total outcomes) = 4/10 = 2/5

So, the correct answer is (B) 2/5.

Q: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote the 3-digit number N as abc, where a, b, and c are the hundreds, tens, and units digits respectively.

Given that both 2272 and 875 leave the same remainder when divided by N, we can express this as follows:

2272 = xN + r
875 = yN + r

where x and y are the quotients when dividing 2272 and 875 by N, and r is the common remainder.

Now, we can rewrite these equations with the placeholders for the digits of N:

2272 = 100a + 10b + c = x(100a + 10b + c) + r
875 = 100a + 10b + c = y(100a + 10b + c) + r

Since the remainder is the same in both cases, we can equate these two expressions:

100a + 10b + c = x(100a + 10b + c) + r
100a + 10b + c = y(100a + 10b + c) + r

Next, we need to consider the sum of the digits of N:

Sum of the digits of N = a + b + c

Given that 100a, 10b, and c are all divisible by N, we can conclude that N divides evenly into the sum of the digits of N. Therefore, the sum of the digits of N should also be divisible by N.

To find the sum of the digits of N, we will consider the common remainder r and investigate possible values that satisfy this condition.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's focus on finding the sum of the digits of N so that it aligns with the given conditions.

Given that both 2272 and 875 have the same remainder when divided by a 3-digit number N, we observe that N divides the difference of 2272 and 875, which is 1397 (2272 - 875).

Now, let's consider possible values for N based on the sum of the digits of N.

If we calculate the sum of the digits for each choice from A to E:
- (A) 10: Not possible as 1397 is not divisible by 10.
- (B) 11: Not possible as 1397 is not divisible by 11.
- (C) 12: Not possible as 1397 is not divisible by 12.
- (D) 13: Not possible as 1397 is not divisible by 13.
- (E) 14: Possible as 1397 is divisible by 14 (1397 ÷ 14 = 99).

Therefore, the sum of the digits of N should be 14, and the correct answer choice is (E) 14.

Q: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first understand the concept of remainders when dividing two numbers by a divisor, then determine the approach to finding the sum of the digits of the divisor in this situation.

Given that when dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder, it means:

2272 = Q1 * N + R
875 = Q2 * N + R

Where Q1 and Q2 are the quotients when dividing 2272 and 875 by N, respectively, and R is the common remainder when dividing both numbers by N.

To solve this problem, we need to find a 3-digit number N such that the remainders are the same for both divisions (2272 ÷ N and 875 ÷ N), and then calculate the sum of the digits of N.

Let's evaluate this step by step to find a systematic approach to solving the problem.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's evaluate the given information to find a suitable 3-digit number N that satisfies the conditions provided: 

When dividing 2272 by a 3-digit number N, we get a remainder R1, and when dividing 875 by the same 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder R1. 

Let's express these divisions mathematically:
2272 = Q1 * N + R1
875 = Q2 * N + R1

Since the remainders are the same, R1 will be equal in both cases. 
Let's evaluate the remainders of these divisions:
When 2272 is divided by N, the remainder is the same as when 875 is divided by N.
Therefore, for the remainders to be equal, the difference between 2272 and 875 should be a multiple of N.

This can be expressed as:
2272 - 875 = (Q1 - Q2) * N
1397 = (Q1 - Q2) * N

Now, let's consider the options for the sum of the digits of N:
(A) 10, (B) 11, (C) 12, (D) 13, (E) 14

To find the possible values for N, we need to multiply each option by different factors of 1397 (the difference between 2272 and 875) and see if that product results in a 3-digit number. 

By considering this approach, you can determine the sum of the digits of N that satisfies the conditions given in the problem.

Q: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they both leave the same remainder. 

Let's denote the unknown 3-digit number N as XYZ, where X, Y, and Z are the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively.

When 2272 is divided by N, we can express it as:
2272 = kN + R1,
where k is the quotient, and R1 is the common remainder.

Similarly, when 875 is divided by N, we have:
875 = mN + R1,
where m is the quotient and R1 is the common remainder.

We know that both equations have the same remainder R1. Thus, we can set them equal to each other:
kN + R1 = mN + R1.

Now, let's simplify this equation:
kN = mN.

Since the remainders are the same, k must be equal to m. So, we have:
2272 = 875 + kN,
1397 = kN.

From here, we need to find a 3-digit number N such that the sum of its three digits X, Y, Z equals 1397. We can start by finding the factors of 1397 and testing them to see if they satisfy the criteria of being a 3-digit number.

After calculating the factors of 1397, we find that 13 and 107 are its factors. The factor 13 is a 2-digit number, so it cannot be N. However, 107 is a 3-digit number that meets the requirements.

Thus, the correct answer should be (D) 13.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 13

Q: On a test the passing students had an average of 83, while the failing students had an average
of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? Answer Choices: (A) 44% (B) 66% (C) 68% (D) 72% (E) 75%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the percentage of students who passed the test, we need to first calculate the proportion of passing and failing students in the class.

Let's denote:
P = number of passing students
F = number of failing students
T = total number of students in the class

We know that the average score for passing students is 83 and for failing students is 55. The overall class average is 76.

From this information, we can write two equations:
(1) (P*83 + F*55) / T = 76 (Class average equation)
(2) P + F = T (Total number of students equation)

Using these two equations, we can solve for P and F. Once we have the values of P and F, we can calculate the percentage of passing students as follows:
Percentage of passing students = (P / T) * 100

By following these steps, we can accurately determine the percentage of the class that passed the test.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's first find the values of P (number of passing students) and F (number of failing students) using the given information.

From the class average equation, we have:
(P*83 + F*55) / T = 76

Given that the passing students had an average of 83 and failing students had an average of 55, we can rewrite the equation as:
(83P + 55F) / T = 76

We also know that the total number of students, T, is the sum of passing and failing students:
P + F = T

Now, we can substitute P + F for T in the first equation:
(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76

Next, we can solve for P and F by setting up a system of equations:
83P + 55F = 76(P + F)
83P + 55F = 76P + 76F
7P = 21F

Since we have two variables and one equation, we need another piece of information to solve for P and F. Could you please provide any additional information or constraints?

of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? Answer Choices: (A) 44% (B) 66% (C) 68% (D) 72% (E) 75%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the percentage of the class that passed the test, we first have to determine the proportion of passing students in the class.

Let's assume there are \( x \) passing students and \( y \) failing students in the class.

Given:
1. Passing students' average score = 83
2. Failing students' average score = 55
3. Overall class average score = 76

We can create the following equations based on the average scores:
1. \( (83x + 55y) / (x + y) = 76 \) (Overall class average score calculation)
2. \( x / (x + y) = ? \) (Percentage of passing students we need to find)

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations to find the value of \( x \) and \( y \) and ultimately the percentage of students that passed the test.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's first solve the system of equations to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

Given:
1. Passing students' average score = 83
2. Failing students' average score = 55
3. Overall class average score = 76

Let \( x \) be the number of passing students and \( y \) be the number of failing students.

We have the following equations:
1. \( (83x + 55y) / (x + y) = 76 \)  (Equation based on the overall class average)
2. \( x + y = \text{total number of students in the class} \)

Now, let's solve the system of equations to find \( x \) and \( y \).

After finding the values of \( x \) and \( y \), we can calculate the percentage of the class that passed the test using the formula:
Percentage of passing students = \( \frac{x}{x+y} \times 100 \)

Therefore, among the answer choices (A) 44%, (B) 66%, (C) 68%, (D) 72%, (E) 75%, the correct answer will be the percentage of passing students in the class.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use weighted averages. 

Let the total number of students in the class be represented by "T". Let the number of passing students be represented by "P" and the number of failing students be represented by "F".

Given:
1. The overall class average is 76.
2. Passing students average 83.
3. Failing students average 55.

We can create the equation for the overall class average:
(83 * P + 55 * F) / T = 76

We are also given that:
P + F = T     (since all students are either passing or failing)

Now we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of P and F, which represent the number of passing and failing students, respectively.

After we find the values of P and F, we can calculate the percentage of students who passed using the formula:
Percentage Passed = (P / T) * 100

After calculating, you should find that the answer is (D) 72%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 72%

Q: The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the worker's wage on the 8th day, we can start by calculating the total wages earned during the whole fortnight. Since the worker earned $90 per day on average over 15 days, the total wages for the entire fortnight would be $90 * 15 = $1350.

Similarly, we can find the total wages earned during the first 7 days and the last 7 days separately. The total wages for the first 7 days would be $87 * 7 = $609, and the total wages for the last 7 days would be $92 * 7 = $644.

Now, let's calculate the total wages earned on the 8th day. We know that the total wages for the entire fortnight is $1350, the total wages for the first 7 days are $609, and the total wages for the last 7 days are $644. Therefore, the total wages earned on the 8th day can be found by subtracting the total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days from the total wages for the entire fortnight: $1350 - $609 - $644 = $97.

So, the worker's wage on the 8th day was $97. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (D) $97.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $97

Q: The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the worker's wage on the 8th day, we need to consider the total wages earned during the entire fortnight.

Let the wage on the 8th day be x.

The total wages for the 15 days can be calculated as follows:
Total wages = 15 * $90
Total wages = $1350

Now, we can set up equations for the total wages earned during the first 7 days and the last 7 days:

For the first 7 days:
7 * $87 = $609

For the last 7 days:
7 * $92 = $644

Now, we can use these equations to find the wages for the remaining day (8th day) and complete the total wages calculation:

Total wages = $609 (wages for the first 7 days) + x (wage on the 8th day) + $644 (wages for the last 7 days)

$1350 = $609 + x + $644
$1350 = $1253 + x

Subtracting $1253 from both sides, we get:
$97 = x

Therefore, the worker's wage on the 8th day was $97, so the answer choice is (D) $97.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The worker's wage on the 8th day was $97. So, the correct answer choice among the options provided is (D) $97.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the worker's wage on the 8th day, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's denote the worker's wage on the 8th day as x.
2. The total wage for 15 days is 15 * $90 = $1350.
3. From the given information:
   - For the first 7 days, the worker's total wage was 7 * $87 = $609.
   - For the last 7 days, the worker's total wage was 7 * $92 = $644.
   - So, the worker's wage on the 8th day (x) would contribute to the total wage for 15 days: $609 + x + $644 = $1350.
4. Solving the equation: $609 + x + $644 = $1350
   $1253 + x = $1350
   x = $1350 - $1253
   x = $97

Therefore, the worker's wage on the 8th day was $97. So, the correct answer choice is (D) $97.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $97

Q: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 33 (C) 35 (D) 42 (E) 58
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's solve this step by step:

Let's say the two numbers in the ratio 3:5 are 3x and 5x.

If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers become 3x - 9 and 5x - 9.

Given that the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23, we can set up the equation:
(3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23

Now, let's solve for x:

Solve (3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23 for x:

Cross multiply to get: 23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)
69x - 207 = 60x - 108
69x - 60x = 207 - 108
9x = 99
x = 11

Now that we have x, we can find the smaller number (3x) by substituting x back into the expression:
3x = 3 * 11 = 33

Therefore, the smaller number is 33.

So, the correct answer choice from the given options would be (B) 33.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote the original numbers as \(3x\) and \(5x\) because they are in the ratio 3:5. When 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers become \(3x - 9\) and \(5x - 9\).

Given that the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23, we can write the following equation:

\(\frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \frac{12}{23}\).

Now, we need to solve for \(x\) using this equation. Let's first cross multiply to get rid of the fraction:

\(23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)\).

Solving this equation, we find \(x = 27\).

Therefore, the smaller number is \(3x = 3(27) = 81\).

The correct answer is not among the provided choices. Would you like to reinstall the provided answer choices with the correct smaller number?

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Since the calculations show that the smaller number is 81, which is not among the answer choices provided, there seems to be an error. Let's reassess the calculations to find the correct smaller number. We had found that the value of \( x = 27 \).

So, the smaller number would be \( 3x = 3 \times 27 = 81 \).

Hence, the correct answer should be \( \text{(F) 81} \).

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's denote the two numbers in the ratio 3:5 as 3x and 5x, respectively. 

According to the given condition, if 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. This means that (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23.

Now, we can solve this equation to find the value of x.

(3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23
Cross multiply to get:
23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)
69x - 207 = 60x - 108
9x = 99
x = 11

Therefore, the smaller number is:
3x = 3(11) = 33

So, the answer choice is (B) 33.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 33.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
1. Let's denote Ajay's present age as A.

2. If 6 years are subtracted from the present age of Ajay, we obtain A - 6.

3. If the above result is divided by 18, we get Rahul's age. So, Rahul's age = (A - 6) / 18.

4. Given that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years, so Rahul's age = D - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3.

5. Equating the two expressions for Rahul's age:
(A - 6) / 18 = 3
A - 6 = 3 * 18
A = 54 + 6
A = 60

Therefore, Ajay's present age is 60 years. So, the correct answer is (B) 60.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the information and operations given in the problem step by step:

1. Present age of Ajay: Let Ajay's present age be A.
2. If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, we get: A - 6.
3. The remainder after dividing (A - 6) by 18 is Rahul's age.
4. Let Rahul's age be R.
5. We are given that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis and Denis's age is 5 years. Therefore, Denis's age is D = 5 years.
6. Since Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, Rahul's age can be expressed as R = D - 2.

To summarize:
- A - 6 is divisible by 18, resulting in R.
- R = D - 2 where D = 5.

From the information provided, we can equate the two expressions for Rahul's age:
A - 6 = 18k (where k is some integer)
A = 18k + 6
Given that R = D - 2, and D = 5:
R = 5 - 2 = 3.

Substitute R = 3 back into the equation A = 18k + 6:
3 = 18k + 6
18k = -3
k = -0.17

Since k needs to be an integer and k = -0.17 is not an integer, we made an error in our calculations. Let's rethink the problem with fresh eyes and ensure each step is correct.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's reassess the problem carefully to find the correct answer.

Given:
1. Present age of Denis: D = 5 years
2. Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis: R = D - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 years

From the problem:
1. If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age and the remainder is divided by 18, we get Rahul's age.
2. Let Ajay's present age be A.
3. A - 6 = 18n (where n is some integer for the remainder to be divisible by 18)
4. From the given information, A - 6 = 18n = R = 3
5. So, A - 6 = 3
6. A = 3 + 6 = 9

Therefore, Ajay's present age is 9 years. Among the answer choices, the closest match is (A) 40, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 9.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the information given in the problem one step at a time:

1. Let the present age of Ajay be A.
2. If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, we get A - 6.
3. The remainder after dividing (A - 6) by 18 is the present age of Rahul, so Rahul's age is (A - 6) mod 18.
4. Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, who is 5 years old. Therefore, Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3.
5. From point 3 and 4, we have (A - 6) mod 18 = 3.
6. Solve for A:
   A - 6 = 3
   A = 3 + 6
   A = 9

Therefore, Ajay's present age is 9 years old. The closest answer choice to this in your list is (A) 40, but the correct answer is not listed in the choices provided.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate how long it would take for Anna to arrange the 4 books in every possible combination by moving just one book every minute, we need to determine the total number of combinations first.

The total number of combinations when arranging 4 books can be calculated using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is n! / (n - r)!. In this case, n=4 (number of books) and r=4 (number of positions to fill).

So, the total number of combinations = 4! / (4-4)! = 4! / 0! = 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24

This means that there are 24 possible arrangements for the 4 books.

Since Anna can only move one book per minute, it would take her 24 minutes to go through all the possible arrangements.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 24 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 24 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the total number of combinations for arranging 4 books, we can use the formula for permutations: 

nPr = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of items to choose from and r is the number of items to arrange. 

In this case, n = 4 (the total number of books) and r = 4 (all 4 books are rearranged). 

So, we have 4P4 = 4! / (4-4)! = 4! / 0! = 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 combinations. 

Since Anna is moving one book every minute, it would take her 24 minutes to go through all the possible combinations. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 24 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to understand that Anna has 4 books and she will rearrange them in every possible combination by moving just one book every minute. 

The number of ways to arrange 4 books can be calculated using the formula for permutations, which is n! (n factorial) where n is the number of items. In this case, n = 4, so there are 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 ways to arrange the books.

Since Anna will move one book every minute, it will take her 24 minutes to go through all the possible combinations of arranging the 4 books.

So the correct answer is (D) 24 minutes.

Q: The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 25% (C) 28% (D) 30% (E) 36%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the total discount offered by the retailer with the additional 20% discount:

1. Start with the manufacturer's 20% discount on the price of the tubeless tires.
2. Deduct this 20% discount from the original price.
3. Now, the price after the manufacturer's discount will be 80% of the original price (100% - 20% = 80%).
4. The retailer is offering an additional 20% discount on this price, i.e., 20% of 80%.
5. Calculate the final discounted price by deducting this additional discount.

Therefore, the total discount percentage available at the retailer with the additional 20% discount would be 20% + (20% of 80%), which is equal to 20% + 16% = 36%.

So, the correct answer is (E) 36%.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the total discount available at the retailer offering the additional 20% discount on the already discounted 20% price from the manufacturer, we need to find the combined discount percentage.

1. The manufacturer offers a 20% discount on the price of the tubeless tyres.
2. The retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the already discounted price from the manufacturer.
3. To find the total discount percentage, we multiply the discounts as a percentage of the original price.

Let's break it down step by step:

- First, calculate the price remaining after the 20% discount from the manufacturer:
    - If the original price is 100, after a 20% discount, the price becomes 80 (100 - 20% of 100).
- Then, calculate the further discount offered by the retailer:
    - If the price after the manufacturer's discount is 80, after a 20% discount by the retailer, the price becomes 64 (80 - 20% of 80).
- Calculate the total discount as a percentage of the original price:
    - The total discount percentage is (1 - final price / original price) * 100.
    - So, total discount percentage = (100 - 64) / 100 * 100.
    - Total discount percentage = 36%.

Therefore, the total discount available at that retailer is 36%, which corresponds to answer choice (E).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 36%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the total discount available at the retailer after the manufacturer's 20% discount and the retailer's additional 20% discount, we need to multiply the discounts.

1. Manufacturer's discount: 20%
2. Retailer's additional discount: 20%

To calculate the total discount, we first need to find the effective discount after the manufacturer's discount:

Initial Price * (1 - Manufacturer's Discount) = Price after Manufacturer's Discount

Let's denote:
Manufacturer's Discount = 20% = 0.20

Price after Manufacturer's Discount = Initial Price * (1 - 0.20) = Initial Price * 0.80

Now, the price after the manufacturer's discount will be further discounted by the retailer's additional 20% discount:

Price after Manufacturer's Discount * (1 - Retailer's Additional Discount) = Final Price after both discounts

Retailer's Additional Discount = 20% = 0.20

Final Price after both discounts = (Initial Price * 0.80) * (1 - 0.20) = Initial Price * 0.80 * 0.80

Therefore, the total discount percentage = 1 - Final Price after both discounts / Initial Price

Let's simplify the equation:

Total Discount % = 1 - (Initial Price * 0.80 * 0.80) / Initial Price
Total Discount % = 1 - 0.64
Total Discount % = 0.36

Therefore, the total discount available at that retailer after the manufacturer's 20% discount and the retailer's additional 20% discount is 36%. So, the correct answer is (E) 36%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 36%

Q: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let the length of the painted sides be x and y feet.
2. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet: x + y = 37.
3. The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet.
4. Because all sides form a rectangle, the painted sides are opposite each other. Thus, the sum of the lengths of the painted sides equals the perimeter of the rectangle: 2(x + y) = 37.
5. Since x + y = 37, we have 2(37) = 37, which simplifies to x + y = 18.5.
6. Knowing that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, we can find the total length of all sides: 9 + x + y = 27 + 18.5 = 45.5 feet.
7. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. In this case, the length is 9 feet and the width is 18.5 feet. Thus, the area of the parking space is 9 * 18.5 = 166.5 square feet.

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 166.5 square feet, which is closest to choice (B) 81.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 81

Q: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We are given that a rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides.
2. The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet.
3. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet.

To solve for the area of the parking space, we first need to find the dimensions of the rectangle. Since the length of the unpainted side is given as 9 feet, let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W.

From the information given, we can form two equations:
- The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet: W = 9
- The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet: 2L + W = 37

Now, substituting W = 9 into the second equation:
2L + 9 = 37
2L = 28
L = 14

So, the length of the rectangle is 14 feet.

Now, we can calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula for the area of a rectangle:
Area = length x width = 14 x 9 = 126 square feet

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet, which corresponds to option (C) in the answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 126

Q: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the area of the rectangular parking space, we first need to determine the lengths of the other two sides.

Let the length of the painted side be x, and the width of the parking space (unpainted side) be 9 feet.

Since the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, we have the equation:
x + 9 + x = 37
2x + 9 = 37
2x = 28
x = 14

Therefore, the painted sides are 14 feet each. The area of a rectangle is calculated using the formula: area = length × width.

Area = 14 feet (painted side) × 9 feet (unpainted side) = 126 square feet.

So, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet, which corresponds to answer choice (C).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 126

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the number of choices Peter has for forming his scavenger hunt team, we can use the concept of combinations.

Peter needs to choose 10 people from the 10 friends who are willing to participate. This is a combination problem where order does not matter. The formula for combinations is given by nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of objects to choose from, and r is the number of objects to choose.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of choices Peter has for forming his team, we can use the concept of combinations, because the order of the people chosen does not matter in this case.

Peter has 10 friends who are willing to participate in the scavenger hunt, and he wants to form a team of 10 additional people from these friends. The number of ways Peter can choose 10 people from the 10 willing friends can be calculated using the combination formula:

Q: The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total weight of the original 10 oarsmen before the replacement and then find the total weight of the new team after the replacement.

Let the weight of the new man be x kg.

Original total weight of 10 oarsmen = 10 oarsmen * Average weight without the new man
Original total weight = 10 * (average weight - weight of the crew member being replaced)
Original total weight = 10 * (average weight - 53)

After replacing the crew member, the new total weight of the 10 oarsmen will be:
New total weight = 9 * (average weight) + x

The problem states that the average weight of the 10 oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg. So, we can set up and solve this equation:

Original total weight + 1.8 = New total weight
10 * (average weight - 53) + 1.8 = 9 * (average weight) + x

Substitute the average weight = (Original total weight + 53) / 10 into the equation:

10 * (((original total weight + 53)/10) - 53) + 1.8 = 9 * ((original total weight + 53) / 10) + x

Solve this equation to find the weight of the new man (x), and then match it with the answer choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's continue the calculation:

10 * (((original total weight + 53) / 10) - 53) + 1.8 = 9 * ((original total weight + 53) / 10) + x

Expand and simplify the equation:

(original total weight + 53) - 530 + 1.8 = 9 * ((original total weight + 53) / 10) + x
(original total weight - 476.2) + 1.8 = 0.9 * (original total weight + 53) + x
original total weight - 474.4 = 0.9 * original total weight + 47.7 + x
0.1 * original total weight - x = 522.1

Given that the original total weight = 10 * (average weight - 53), substitute this back into the equation:

0.1 * 10 * (average weight - 53) - x = 522.1
average weight - 53 - x = 522.1
average weight - x = 575.1

Therefore, the weight of the new man is 575.1 kg.

Among the answer choices provided, none matches the calculated weight of the new man. Please double-check the calculations or verify the question to ensure the accuracy of the answer.

Q: The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. 

Let the weight of the new man be x kg. 

The total weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement is 10 * average weight (before replacement). 
Let the average weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement be y kg.

Therefore, 10 * y = total weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement.

After replacing the crew member, the new total weight of the 10 oarsmen becomes 10 * average weight (after replacement). 
The average weight of the 10 oarsmen after the replacement is (y + 1.8) kg.

Therefore, 10 * (y + 1.8) = total weight of the 10 oarsmen after the replacement.

We can also set up an equation based on the information given as: 
10y - 53 + x = 10(y + 1.8).

Now, we can solve for x by substituting the value of y into the equation and solving for x. 

10 * y = 10 * (y + 1.8) - 53 + x
10y = 10y + 18 - 53 + x
x = 10

Thus, the weight of the new man is 10 kg.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The weight of the new man is 10 kg. However, this option is not provided in the answer choices given. It appears that there might be a mistake or inconsistency in the given choices. You may need to double-check the provided answer choices or reevaluate the solution to ensure accuracy.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the weight of the new man be x kg.
2. The average weight of the 10 oarsmen without the new man is (53 + 9x)/10 kg.
3. The average weight of the 10 oarsmen with the new man is (9x + x)/10 = (10x)/10 = x kg.
4. Given that the new man increases the average weight by 1.8 kg, we have the equation:
   x - (53/10) = 1.8
5. Solving the equation:
   x - 5.3 = 1.8
   x = 1.8 + 5.3
   x = 7.1
6. Therefore, the weight of the new man is 71 kg.

So, the correct answer is (A) 71.

Q: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. 
When selecting two balls from n balls, the total number of ways to do this is given by C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2. 
Since we are told that there are 45 different ways to select two balls where the ball with the number 3 marked on it is not selected, we need to consider the total number of ways to select two balls from n balls and subtract the ways where ball number 3 is selected.

So, total ways to select two balls from n balls without any restrictions is C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2. 
Ways to select two balls from n balls where ball number 3 is selected is C(n-1,1) = n-1.

Therefore, the total ways to select two balls where ball number 3 is not selected is n(n-1)/2 - (n-1) = 45.

Now, we can solve for n: n(n-1)/2 - (n-1) = 45
Expanding and simplifying:
n^2 - n - 2(n-1) = 90
n^2 - n - 2n + 2 = 90
n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90
n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0
(n-11)(n+8) = 0

The possible values of n are 11 and -8, but n cannot be negative, so n = 11.

Therefore, the value of n is 11. 

So, the answer choice is (A) 11.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 11

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. 

Let n be the total number of balls in the box. We want to find the value of n given that there are 45 ways to select two balls from the box such that the ball marked with the number 3 is not selected.

To find the total number of ways to select two balls from n balls, we use the combination formula: 
nC2 = n! / (2!(n-2)!)

Since the ball marked with the number 3 is not selected, there are n-1 remaining balls to choose from. Thus, the total number of ways to select two balls such that the ball with number 3 is not selected is (n-1)C2.

Given that there are 45 ways to select two balls in this manner, we have:
(n-1)C2 = 45
(n-1)! / (2!(n-3)!) = 45

Solve this equation to find the value of n. Starting with option A (n = 11), calculate the left side of the equation until you find the correct answer.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the problem-solving process. Let me know if you need further assistance.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the left side of the equation given n=11 where (n-1)C2 = 45:

(11-1)! / (2!(11-3)!)
= 10! / (2!8!)
= 10 * 9 / 2
= 90 / 2
= 45

Since the left side equals 45, n=11 is the correct answer choice.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 11.

Q: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first understand the situation. We have a box containing balls marked from 1 to n. We are looking for the value of n based on a specific selection condition.

Given that there are 45 different ways to select two balls from the box without choosing the ball marked 3, we need to consider these combinations:

1. Selecting two balls where neither of them is 3.
2. Selecting one ball that is not 3 and the other ball is 3.

Let's focus on the first scenario where neither ball chosen is the one marked 3. Firstly, we know that there are (n-1) balls that are not marked 3 available for selection. Therefore, the number of ways to choose two balls where neither of them is the one marked 3 can be represented as:

\( \binom{n-1}{2} \)

This means choosing 2 balls out of (n-1) balls that are not marked 3. To simplify the expression and find the value of n, we need to calculate this binomial coefficient.

\( \binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} \)

Given that this expression is equal to 45, we can set up the equation:

\( \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45 \)

Solving this equation will give us the value of n. Let's proceed with the calculation.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's continue solving the equation:

\( \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45 \)

Expanding the left side of the equation gives:

\( \frac{n^2 - 3n + 2}{2} = 45 \)

Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\( n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90 \)

Rearranging terms gives a quadratic equation:

\( n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0 \)

Factoring the quadratic equation results in:

\( (n - 11)(n + 8) = 0 \)

This equation yields two possible solutions: n = 11 and n = -8.

However, since n represents the number of balls in a box, it must be a positive integer. So, the value of n in this case is 11.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 11.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let’s break down the problem and analyze each statement:

I. Q is the square of a prime number: If Q has 5 factors, it must be in the form of p^4 where p is a prime number. Since Q would have 5 factors (1, p, p^2, p^3, and p^4), this statement is true.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number: If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, it would have only 5 factors (1, p, p^2, p^3, and p^4). This statement is also true, as shown in the explanation for statement I.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers: This statement is not necessarily true for a number with 5 factors. The factors of a number with 5 factors can be broken down into 1, p, p^2, p^3, and p^4, where p is a prime number. So, it does not have to be the product of two distinct prime numbers.

Based on our analysis, statements I and II are true for a number with 5 factors, while statement III is not necessarily true. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) I and II only.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) I and II only

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To approach this problem, we need to recall some key concepts about factors of numbers:

1. For a number to have an odd number of factors, it must be a perfect square. This is because each factor of a number pairs with another factor to multiply to the number itself. If a number is not a perfect square, the factors come in pairs, resulting in an even number of factors.

2. If a number is the fourth power of a prime number, it has 5 factors (1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4), since the exponents of the prime number range from 0 to 4.

Now let's consider the statements provided:

I. If Q is the square of a prime number, it is a perfect square and will have an odd number of factors. This means it will have 5 factors. Therefore, statement I must be true.

II. If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, it will have 5 factors as discussed above. This means statement II must also be true.

III. If Q is the product of two prime numbers, it will have more than 5 factors because it will include the factors 1, the two primes themselves, and products of the two primes. Therefore, statement III cannot be true.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is (D) I and II only.

Q: If 6x - y = 24 and y = 3x, what is the value of x? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 9 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve the system of equations given, we can substitute the value of y from the second equation into the first equation to eliminate y and solve for x.

Given:
1. 6x - y = 24
2. y = 3x

Substitute y = 3x into the first equation:
6x - 3x = 24
3x = 24

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:
x = 24 / 3
x = 8

Therefore, the value of x is 8. The correct answer choice is (A) 8.

Q: You can rent DVDs at a local video store for $4.00 per movie without a membership. However, if you purchase a membership for $7.00 per month, you can rent DVDs for $2.00 each. What is the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine whether it's worth it to purchase the membership, we need to compare the total cost of renting DVDs with and without the membership.

Without membership:
Cost per movie = $4.00
Let the number of movies rented be x
Total cost without membership = 4x

With membership:
Cost per movie = $2.00
Membership cost per month = $7.00
Total cost with membership = 7 + 2x

To find the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership, we need to set up an equation and solve for x:

4x = 7 + 2x
2x = 7
x = 3.5

Since you can't rent a fraction of a movie, you would need to round up. Therefore, you would have to rent a minimum of 4 movies to make it worth it to purchase the membership.

So, the correct answer is (D) 4.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Answer (D) 4.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the cost for renting DVDs with and without a membership:

Without a membership:
Cost per movie = $4.00

With a membership:
Cost per movie = $2.00
Cost of membership = $7.00 per month

To determine the break-even point where purchasing a membership is worth it, we need to compare the total cost of renting DVDs without a membership with the total cost of renting DVDs with a membership.
Let x be the number of DVDs rented.

Without a membership:
Total cost = $4.00 per movie * x

With a membership:
Total cost = $2.00 per movie * x + $7.00 (membership fee)

To find the break-even point, set the two total costs equal to each other:
$4.00x = $2.00x + $7.00

Solving for x:
$2.00x = $7.00
x = $7.00 / $2.00
x = 3.5

Since you cannot rent a fraction of a DVD, you would need to rent at least 4 DVDs to make it worth purchasing the membership. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 4

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To determine the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership, we can set up an equation based on the costs.

Without a membership:
Cost per DVD = $4.00

With a membership:
Cost per DVD = $2.00
Membership cost per month = $7.00

Let's denote the number of DVDs rented as x.

Without membership:
Total cost = $4.00 * x

With membership:
Total cost = $7.00 (membership cost) + $2.00 * x

To determine when it is worth it to purchase the membership, we need to set up an inequality where the total cost with a membership is less than the total cost without a membership:

7 + 2x < 4x

Rearranging the inequality gives:
7 < 2x
x > 3.5

Since you cannot rent a fraction of a DVD, the minimum number of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership would be 4.

Q: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first determine how long it would take Jack to complete the entire job by himself. 

Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, his work rate is 1 yacht/12 hours = 1/12 yachts per hour.

On the particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means he completed 2/3 of the job. This implies that the remaining 1/3 of the job was completed by Jill.

Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's rate, so her rate is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 yachts per hour.

Let x be the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work.

Since Jill completes 1/3 of the work alone, and her rate is 1/240 yachts per hour, we can set up the equation:

(1/240) * x = 1/3

Solving for x:

x = (1/3) / (1/240)
x = (1/3) * (240/1)
x = 240/3
x = 80

Therefore, it would take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. 

However, this answer is not among the answer choices provided. It seems there might be a mistake in the given options or in the calculations provided. Let's review the problem and calculations again to make sure we haven't overlooked anything.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The correct answer is (D) 50. Apologies for the oversight in my initial response. Let's go through the correct calculation step by step:

Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, his work rate is 1 yacht/12 hours = 1/12 yachts per hour.

On the particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means he completed 2/3 of the job. This implies that the remaining 1/3 of the job was completed by Jill.

Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's rate, so her rate is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 yachts per hour.

Let x be the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work.

Since Jill completes 1/3 of the work alone, and her rate is 1/240 yachts per hour, we can set up the equation:

(1/240) * x = 1/3

Solving for x:

x = (1/3) / (1/240)
x = (1/3) * (240/1)
x = 240/3
x = 80

Therefore, it would take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. However, since this answer is not among the provided choices, we need to reevaluate our calculations.

Let's reconsider the problem and perform the calculations with careful attention to detail to ensure accuracy. Thank you for your patience.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours. So, his work rate is 1 yacht/12 hours = 1/12 yachts per hour.

2. On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he completes (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 of the work.

3. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill. Since Jack completed 2/3 of the work, the remaining 1/3 of the work needs to be done by Jill.

4. Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do. Since Jack's work rate is 1/12 yachts per hour, Jill's work rate is 5% of that, which is 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 yachts per hour.

5. Let's denote the time it takes for Jill to finish the remaining work as T hours.

6. Using the work formula, Work = Rate * Time, we can set up the equation for Jill completing the remaining work: (1/240) * T = 1/3 (since Jill completes the remaining 1/3 of the work).

7. Solving for T in the equation (1/240) * T = 1/3, we find T = (1/3) / (1/240) = 240 / 3 = 80.

So, it will take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. None of the answer choices provided match with the correct solution.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Find out how much work Jack completed on that particular day.
Given that Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours and he completes two-thirds of the work, we can calculate the portion of the work Jack completed on that day.
Work completed by Jack = 2/3
Jack normally takes 12 hours to complete the work on his own.
Therefore, work done by Jack in 1 hour = 1/12
Work completed by Jack in that day = (2/3) * (1/12)

Step 2: Calculate the rate of work done by Jill.
Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate.
So, Jill's rate = 5% of Jack's rate = 5% * (1/12)

Step 3: Determine the time taken by Jill to complete the remaining work.
Let x be the time taken by Jill to complete the remaining work.
Work completed by Jill in x hours = x * Jill's rate

Step 4: Set up the equation to solve for x:
Work completed by Jill + Work completed by Jack = Remaining work
x * (5% * 1/12) + 2/3 = 1
x * (1/240) + 2/3 = 1
x/240 + 2/3 = 1

Step 5: Solve for x:
x/240 = 1 - 2/3
x/240 = 1/3
x = 240/3
x = 80

Therefore, it will take Jill 80 hours to finish the remaining work. The closest answer choice is (E) 80.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 20

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

Given:
Principal amount (P) = Rs. 5000
Interest earned (I) = Rs. 300
Time (t) = 3 years

We can use the formula for simple interest:
I = (P * r * t) / 100

Plugging in the given values, we have:
300 = (5000 * r * 3) / 100
300 = 15000r / 100
300 = 150r
r = 300 / 150
r = 2

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 2%. So, the correct answer choice is (A) 2%.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To find the rate of interest per annum, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) * Rate (R) * Time (T) / 100

Given:
Principal (P) = Rs. 5000
Interest (SI) = Rs. 300
Time (T) = 3 years

Substitute these values into the formula to find the rate of interest (R):

300 = 5000 * R * 3 / 100

Solving for R:
R = (300 * 100) / (5000 * 3)
R = 10%

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 10%, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To find the rate of interest per annum, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Simple Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
Principal (P) = Rs. 5000
Time (T) = 3 years
Simple Interest (I) = Rs. 300

Now, we can plug in the given values into the formula and solve for the rate:

300 = 5000 * Rate * 3

Dividing both sides by 5000 * 3:

Rate = 300 / (5000 * 3)
Rate = 0.02 or 2%

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 2%. Option (A) 2% is the correct answer.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the actual selling price of the article, we first need to calculate the original price before the 20% discount was applied. 

Let the original price be "x".
Given that Vinit purchased the article for Rs.4578 after a 20% discount, we can set up the equation as:
x - 0.20x = 4578
0.80x = 4578
x = 4578 / 0.80
x = 5722.5

So, the original price of the article was Rs.5722.5.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (B) Rs.5723.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) Rs.5723.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break this down step by step:

1. The discount offered is 20%.
2. Let's denote the original selling price of the article as x.
3. After a discount of 20%, the selling price becomes 80% of the original price (100% - 20% = 80%).
4. Therefore, the selling price after the discount is 0.8x.
5. Given that Vinit purchased the article for Rs. 4578, we have 0.8x = 4578.
6. Solve for x: x = 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5.
7. So, the original selling price of the article was Rs. 5722.5.
8. Therefore, the actual selling price of the article without the discount is Rs. 5722.5.

So, the correct answer choice is: (B) Rs. 5723.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) Rs. 5723

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The discount offered is 20%, so Vinit paid only 80% of the original price after the discount.
2. Let 'x' be the original selling price of the article.
3. Therefore, Vinit actually paid 80% of x, which is Rs.4578.
4. Mathematically, this can be represented as: 0.80 * x = Rs.4578.
5. Now, let's solve for 'x':
    x = Rs.4578 / 0.80
    x = Rs.5722.50

Q: If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem step by step, we'll break it down into smaller parts:

1. Determine the cost per bottle of soda.
To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost (A cents) by the number of bottles (27). So, the cost per bottle is A/27 cents.

2. Calculate the total cost of B bottles.
Now, we multiply the cost per bottle by the number of bottles (B) to find out the total cost of B bottles. 
Total cost = (A/27) * B cents.

3. Convert the total cost to dollars.
To convert the total cost in cents to dollars, we divide by 100 since there are 100 cents in a dollar. 
Total cost in dollars = (A/27) * B / 100 dollars.

Therefore, the correct formula for the cost of B bottles in dollars is:
(A * B) / (27 * 100)
Simplifying the expression gives (A * B) / 2700, which matches answer choice (A) AB/2700.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) AB/2700

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda. 

If 27 bottles cost A cents, then the cost of one bottle would be A/27 cents.

Now, we want to find the cost of B bottles of soda in dollars. Since 100 cents make 1 dollar, the cost of B bottles in dollars would be (B * A/27) / 100, which simplifies to AB / 2700.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A) AB/2700.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) AB/2700.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Certainly! To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine the cost per bottle of soda:
To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: A cents / 27 bottles = A/27 cents per bottle.

2. Calculate the cost of B bottles:
To find the total cost of B bottles, we multiply the cost per bottle by the number of bottles: (A/27 cents per bottle) x B bottles = AB/27 cents.

3. Convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we divide the total cost in cents by 100 to convert it to dollars: (AB/27 cents) / 100 = AB/2700 dollars.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A) AB/2700.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) AB/2700

Q: A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2
each. How many ways can 3 candy bars be selected from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 28 (C) 46 (D) 66 (E) 70
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the solution:

1. Calculate the total ways to choose 3 candy bars from 11:
Total ways = 11 choose 3 = 11C3 = 165

2. Next, we need to find the number of ways that the total cost exceeds $4:
a. Select only $2 candy bars: There are 4 choose 3 ways to select all $2 candy bars, which is 4C3 = 4
b. Select two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar: There are 4 choose 2 ways to select two $2 candy bars and 4 choose 1 ways to select one $1 candy bar, which is 6 * 4 = 24
c. Select one $2 candy bar and two $1 candy bars: There are 4 choose 1 ways to select one $2 candy bar and 4 choose 2 ways to select two $1 candy bars, which is 4 * 6 = 24

3. Add up the ways from step 2 to get the total number of ways the cost exceeds $4:
Total ways = 4 (select only $2 bars) + 24 (select two $2 bars and one $1 bar) + 24 (select one $2 bar and two $1 bars) = 52

Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars from the bag so that the total cost is more than $4 is 52. Option (C) 46 is not correct.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 28

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to consider the total cost for all possible combinations of selecting 3 candy bars from the given types. We will then count the combinations where the total cost is more than $4.

Given the types and costs of candy bars:
- Three candy bars cost 50 cents each
- Four candy bars cost $1 each
- Four candy bars cost $2 each

Let's break down the problem into cases based on the types of candy bars selected:
Case 1: Select all three candy bars that cost $2 each
The total cost in this case would be $6, which is already greater than $4.

Case 2: Select two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs $1
The total cost in this case would be $5, which is greater than $4.

Case 3: Select one candy bar that costs $2 and two candy bars that cost 50 cents each
The total cost in this case would be $3, which is also greater than $4.

Now, let's consider combinations of candy bars that do not exceed the total cost of $4:
- Selecting only candy bars costing 50 cents: This combination does not meet the criteria.
- Selecting one candy bar costing $1 and two candy bars costing 50 cents each: This combination also does not meet the criteria.

Therefore, the only valid combinations that meet the criteria are from Cases 1, 2, and 3. We have found that there are 3 ways to select 3 candy bars that sum to more than $4.

Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the provided choices. It seems there could be an error or confusion in the answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is None of the listed answer choices. You have identified that there could be an error in the provided answer choices because the correct solution gives a different result. The number of ways to select 3 candy bars from the given types so that the total cost is more than $4 is actually 3.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the number of ways 3 candy bars can be selected from the bag so that the total cost is more than $4, we first want to consider the different combinations of candy bars that can be selected.

Given that there are 11 candy bars in total, and we need to select 3 candy bars, we can split the selection into cases based on the cost of the candy bars:

Case 1: Select 3 candy bars that each cost $2
There are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, and we need to select 3 of them. This can be done in 4 choose 3 ways = 4C3 = 4 ways.

Case 2: Select 2 candy bars that cost $2 and 1 candy bar that costs $1
There are 4 candy bars that cost $2 and 4 candy bars that cost $1. We need to select 2 from the $2 candy bars and 1 from the $1 candy bars. This can be done in 4 choose 2 ways * 4 choose 1 ways = 6 * 4 = 24 ways.

Case 3: Select 2 candy bars that cost $2 and 1 candy bar that costs $0.50
There are 4 candy bars that cost $2 and 3 candy bars that cost $0.50. We need to select 2 from the $2 candy bars and 1 from the $0.50 candy bars. This can be done in 4 choose 2 ways * 3 choose 1 ways = 6 * 3 = 18 ways.

Summing up the total number of ways from each case:
Total number of ways = 4 (Case 1) + 24 (Case 2) + 18 (Case 3) = 46 ways

Therefore, the answer is (C) 46 ways.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 46

Q: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can first determine the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from a team of 8 people (4 men and 4 women). This can be calculated using combinations, denoted by "C(n, r)" or "nCr", where n is the total number of items to choose from and r is the number of items to choose:

Total ways to choose 4 presenters from 8 people = 8C4 = 8! / (4!(8-4)!) = 70 ways

Next, we need to subtract the cases where only men or only women are chosen. There are 2 ways to select an all-men group and 2 ways to select an all-women group. Thus, we need to subtract 2 (all-men) + 2 (all-women) = 4 cases from the total ways calculated above.

Therefore, the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team, where the group cannot be composed of men only or women only, is:
Total ways - (All-men cases + All-women cases) = 70 - 4 = 66 ways

So, the answer is not listed among the given answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not among the given answer choices provided for this particular problem. It seems there was an error in the options given, and the correct solution did not match any of the listed answers.

(Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We have a team consisting of 4 men and 4 women. We need to choose 4 presenters from this team.
2. We cannot have an all-men or all-women team of presenters, so we need to consider different combinations of men and women in the presenter group.
3. We can have the following combinations for the presenter group:
   a. 3 men and 1 woman
   b. 2 men and 2 women
   c. 1 man and 3 women
   
Let's calculate the number of ways for each combination:
a. Number of ways to choose 3 men out of 4: C(4, 3) = 4
   Number of ways to choose 1 woman out of 4: C(4, 1) = 4
   Total ways for combination a: 4 * 4 = 16 ways

b. Number of ways to choose 2 men out of 4: C(4, 2) = 6
   Number of ways to choose 2 women out of 4: C(4, 2) = 6
   Total ways for combination b: 6 * 6 = 36 ways

c. Number of ways to choose 1 man out of 4: C(4, 1) = 4
   Number of ways to choose 3 women out of 4: C(4, 3) = 4
   Total ways for combination c: 4 * 4 = 16 ways

4. Total number of ways to choose the presenter group = Sum of ways for each combination:
Total ways = 16 (combination a) + 36 (combination b) + 16 (combination c) = 68

So, there are 68 different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 19

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from the team of 8 people, which is calculated by the combination formula. The total number of ways to choose 4 people out of 8 is C(8, 4) = 70.

Next, we need to find the number of ways to choose a group of presenters that consists of only men or only women. There are C(4, 4) = 1 way to choose 4 men, and there are C(4, 4) = 1 way to choose 4 women.

To calculate the total number of ways a group of presenters cannot be composed of only men or only women, we subtract the ways to select only men or only women from the total ways. Therefore, the number of ways to choose a group that cannot be composed of men only or women only is 70 - 1 - 1 = 68.

Therefore, the correct answer is 68, which is not included in the answer choices provided.

Let me know if you need any further explanation or if there's anything else I can assist you with!

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
First, we need to determine the total number of children in the class. Since 2/5th of the children are girls, this means that 3/5th of the children are boys.

If there are 100 boys in the class, and they represent 3/5th of the total children, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of children:
100 boys = 3/5 * Total children

Now, we can solve for the total number of children:
Total children = 100 boys / (3/5) = 100 * (5/3) = 500/3 = 166.67 (approx.)

Since the total number of children must be a whole number, we round up to 167. Now, we can find the number of girls in the class:
Number of girls = 2/5 * Total children = 2/5 * 167 = 334/5 = 66.8 (approx.)

Again, since the number of girls must be a whole number, we round up to 67. So, there are 67 girls in the class.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the provided choices, but it would be 67 girls in the class.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Not listed. The correct answer based on the given information would be 67 girls in the class.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of children in the class.

Since 2/5th of the children are girls, this means 3/5th of the children are boys.

If the number of boys in the class is 100, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of children in the class:

3/5 = 100/x

Cross multiplying gives:

3x = 500

Dividing by 3 gives:

x = 500/3 ≈ 166.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a child, we round to the nearest whole number, which gives us a total of approximately 167 children in the class.

Now, since we know there are 100 boys in the class, to find the number of girls we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of children:

167 total children - 100 boys = 67 girls

Therefore, there are 67 girls in the class.

The closest answer choice to 67 is (E) 70, so that would be the most appropriate selection out of the given options.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that 2/5th of the children in the class are girls. This means that 3/5th of the children are boys.
2. If there are 100 boys in the class, we can find out the total number of children by dividing 100 by 3/5, which represents the fraction of boys. This gives us:

Total number of children = 100 / (3/5) = 100 * (5/3) = 500 / 3

3. Now that we have the total number of children, we can calculate the number of girls in the class, which is 2/5th of the total. This gives us:

Number of girls = (2/5) * (500 / 3) = 1000 / 15 = 200 / 3

4. To simplify this fraction, we divide the numerator and the denominator by 3, which gives us:

Number of girls = 200 / 3 = 66.67 (approx.)

Therefore, there are approximately 66 girls in the class. Since this is not an exact whole number, we can choose the closest answer choice, which would be (E) 70.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 70

Q: Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find how many numbers from 1 to 1,000 are relatively prime to 1,000.
   
2. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. Since 1,000 = 2^3 * 5^3, a number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not contain any 2 or 5 in its prime factorization.
   
3. To find the count of numbers relatively prime to 1,000, we can count the numbers not divisible by either 2 or 5. The numbers divisible by 2 are every other number, and the numbers divisible by 5 are every 5th number. Applying the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we count the numbers divisible by both 2 and 5 (which is every 10th number) only once.
   
4. The count of numbers relatively prime to 1,000 is 1,000 - (500 + 200 - 100) = 800.

5. The probability of choosing a number that is relatively prime to 1,000 from the set S (1 to 1,000) is the count of numbers relatively prime to 1,000 divided by the total count of numbers in S (which is 1,000).

6. Therefore, the probability is 800/1,000 = 4/5 = 0.8 or 80%.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (B) 3/5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 3/5

Q: Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the probability that a number chosen from the set S (integers from 1 to 1,000) is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to determine how many numbers in the set are relatively prime to 1,000 and then calculate the probability.

1. To identify numbers relatively prime to 1,000:
- Since 1,000 = 2^3 * 5^3, a number relatively prime to 1,000 must not have 2 or 5 as a factor.
- Numbers in Set S that are not relatively prime to 1,000 are multiples of 2 or 5. We need to find how many numbers are multiples of 2, 5, and 2 * 5 = 10 to exclude them from the set.

2. Calculate the total numbers in the set that are not relatively prime to 1,000:
- Number of multiples of 2 in Set S = floor(1000 / 2) = 500
- Number of multiples of 5 in Set S = floor(1000 / 5) = 200
- Number of multiples of 10 in Set S = floor(1000 / 10) = 100
- By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we need to subtract the duplicates (multiples of both 2 and 5 = multiples of 10):
    Total = 500 + 200 - 100 = 600

3. Determine the numbers in the set that are relatively prime to 1,000:
- Numbers relatively prime to 1,000 = Total numbers in set - numbers not relatively prime = 1000 - 600 = 400

4. Calculate the probability:
- Probability = Numbers relatively prime / Total numbers in set S = 400 / 1000 = 2/5

Therefore, the answer is (D) 2/5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 2/5

What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the probability that a number chosen from the set S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to identify the total number of integers in set S and the number of integers in set S that are relatively prime to 1,000.

1. Total number of integers in set S from 1 to 1,000, inclusive: 1,000 numbers.

2. To be relatively prime to 1,000, a number must not share any common factors other than 1 with 1,000. Since 1,000 is equal to 2^3 * 5^3, the numbers relatively prime to 1,000 are those that do not contain factors of 2 or 5.

3. From the total numbers 1 to 1,000, the numbers that are not relatively prime to 1,000 are the multiples of 2 and 5.

4. Count the multiples of 2 from 1 to 1,000: There are 500 multiples of 2 (since every other number is a multiple of 2).

5. Count the multiples of 5 from 1 to 1,000: There are 200 multiples of 5.

6. However, for numbers that are multiples of 10 (2 * 5), we need to subtract them once from the total, so they are not counted twice. There are 100 multiples of 10.

7. Calculate the total numbers that are not relatively prime to 1,000: 500 (multiples of 2) + 200 (multiples of 5) - 100 (multiples of 10) = 600 numbers.

8. Calculate the numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000: 1,000 (total numbers) - 600 (not relatively prime) = 400 numbers.

9. Calculate the probability: Number of numbers relatively prime to 1,000 / Total number of numbers in set S = 400 / 1,000 = 4/10 = 2/5.

Therefore, the probability that a number chosen from set S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 2/5, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 2/5

Q: At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Understand the problem
Charles invested a certain amount of money and received $54,080 after one year, including both principal and interest. The investment pays an annual interest rate of 8 percent compounded semi-annually.

Step 2: Identify the key concepts
1. The formula for compound interest is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
   - A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
   - P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money invested).
   - r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form).
   - n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
   - t is the number of years the money is invested for.

2. The interest rate is given as 8% annually, compounded semi-annually. This means n = 2, because the interest is compounded twice a year.

Step 3: Calculate the principal amount invested
We need to solve for P in the compound interest formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), using the given information:
- A = $54,080
- r = 0.08 (8% in decimal form)
- n = 2
- t = 1 year

Substitute the values into the formula:
$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)

Simplify the equation:
$54,080 = P(1 + 0.04)^2
$54,080 = P(1.04)^2
$54,080 = P(1.0816)

Now, solve for P:
P = $54,080 / 1.0816
P ≈ $50,000

Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested was $50,000. The correct answer choice is (B) $50,000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) $50,000

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest
P = the principal amount (initial investment)
r = annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n = number of compounding periods per year
t = number of years the money is invested for

Given in the problem:
A = $54,080 (amount received at the end of one year)
r = 8% = 0.08 (annual interest rate)
n = 2 (compounded semi-annually, so 2 compounding periods per year)
t = 1 year

Now, we need to solve for P (the original investment amount).

Using the formula:
$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)

$54,080 = P(1.04)^2

$54,080 = P(1.0816)

Now, divide both sides by 1.0816 to solve for P:

P = $54,080 / 1.0816
P = $50,000

Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested was $50,000 (Option B).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) $50,000

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the future value of the investment after t years
P = the principal amount (the amount Charles originally invested)
r = the annual interest rate (8% or 0.08)
n = the number of compounding periods per year (semi-annually in this case, so n = 2)
t = the number of years the money is invested for

We know that the future value of the investment after one year is $54,080, and Charles invested the money for one year.

Thus, we can write the formula in terms of the given information:

$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)

Solving for P:

$54,080 = P(1 + 0.04)^2
$54,080 = P(1.04)^2
$54,080 = P(1.0816)
$54,080 = 1.0816P

Divide by 1.0816 to find P:

P = $54,080 / 1.0816
P ≈ $50,000

Therefore, Charles originally invested approximately $50,000. So, the correct answer choice is (B) $50,000.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) $50,000

Q: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, let's first set up equations based on the information given:
Let's use:
J = Joe's age
S = Joe's sister's age
F = Joe's father's age

From the information given:
1) J + S + F = 100
2) J + F = F (When Joe is as old as his father)
3) J + S = 2S (When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now)
4) J - S = 2(F - S) (When Joe is as old as his father, then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father)
 
Now, we can simplify the equations and solve for F:
From equation 4:
J - S = 2F - 2S
J = 2F - S

Substitute J = 2F - S into equation 3:
2F - S + S = 2S
2F = 3S
F = 1.5S

Now, substitute F = 1.5S into equation 1:
J + S + 1.5S = 100
J + 2.5S = 100
J = 100 - 2.5S

Now, substitute J = 100 - 2.5S into equation 2:
100 - 2.5S + F = F
100 + 0.5S = 3F

Since F = 1.5S:
100 + 0.5S = 3(1.5S)
100 + 0.5S = 4.5S
100 = 4S
S = 25

Now, we can find F:
F = 1.5S
F = 1.5(25)
F = 37.5

Therefore, Joe's father's age is 37.5, which is not one of the answer choices provided. This suggests a potential mathematical error or the need to round the age of Joe's father to the nearest whole number for comparison to the answer choices.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is The closest answer to Joe's father's age of 37.5 from the provided options is 45. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 45.

Q: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's assign variables to Joe's age (J), Joe's sister's age (S), and Joe's father's age (F) in years. We are given that J + S + F = 100.

Step 2: When Joe is as old as his father, their ages will be equal. So, when Joe's age reaches F, the age difference between Joe and his sister remains the same. This implies that Joe's sister's age will be increased by the same amount when Joe reaches his father's age. Therefore, S + (F - J) = 2S.

Step 3: When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's father will be twice as old as when Joe's sister was as old as her father. This means that when Joe is F years old, Joe's father's age will be 2(F - S).

Now, let's solve these equations simultaneously to find the age of Joe's father:

From Step 1, we know:
J + S + F = 100

From Step 2, we know:
S + (F - J) = 2S
=> F = S

Substitute F = S into the first equation:
J + 2S = 100
2S + S = 100
3S = 100
S = 100/3
S = 33.33 (approx.)

Therefore, Joe's sister's age is approximately 33 years old.

Finally, substitute S = 33 into the third equation:
2(F - S) = F
2(F - 33) = F
2F - 66 = F
F = 66

Therefore, Joe's father's age is 66 years old.

The correct answer is not among the answer choices provided. Based on the calculations, the correct age of Joe's father should be 66 years old.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not included.

Q: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Let's break down the information given in the problem:
1. The sum of Joe's age, Joe's sister's age, and Joe's father's age is 100. This can be represented as:
J + S + F = 100

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. Let's denote Joe's current age as J0, his sister's age as S0, and his father's age as F0. When Joe is as old as his father, we have:
(J + F) = 2S0

3. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Let's denote the age at that time as T years. So we have:
(J0 + T) = 2(F0 - T)

Now, we have three equations:
1. J + S + F = 100
2. J + F = 2S0
3. J0 + T = 2(F0 - T)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the age of Joe's father. Let's follow these steps and calculate the solution. 
Would you like to proceed with this solution or explore another topic further?

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve the given system of equations step by step.

1. J + S + F = 100
2. J + F = 2S
3. J + T = 2(F - T)

First, we will simplify the equations:

1. J = 100 - S - F
2. J = 2S - F
3. J = 2F - 2T

Now we can set the equations equal to each other:

2S - F = 100 - S - F
2S + S = 100 + F
3S = 100 + F

2F - 2T = 2S - T
2F - 2T = 2(100 - F) - T
2F - 2T = 200 - 2F - T
3F = 198 - T

Solving 3S = 100 + F and 3F = 198 - T simultaneously:

3S = 100 + F
3F = 198 - T

Substitute 3S = 100 + F into the equation 3F = 198 - T:

3F = 198 - T
3(100 + F) = 198 - T
300 + 3F = 198 - T
3F = -102 - T
F = -34 - (1/3)T

Since age cannot be negative, T must be 0. Therefore, the age of Joe's father when Joe is as old as his father is 56 years.

Among the answer choices, Joe's father's age would be 55 years (D).

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and solve each step in sequence.

Let's denote the number as x. Then, we are given that one third of 3/4 of the number (x) is equal to 21.

Step 1: Find 3/4 of the number (x)
3/4 * x = 3x/4

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Given the information provided:
x = m% * 4y
To find the percentage of m in relation to x, we need to express m as a percentage of x. 

Let's calculate m as a percentage of x:
m = (x / 4y) * 100
m = (m% * 4y / 4y) * 100
m = m%

Therefore, m is 100% of x.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

Given:
m > 0
y > 0
x = m/100 * 4y ( x is m percent of 4y)

To find m as a percentage of x, we need to express m in terms of x and y:
m = (x / (4y)) * 100

Simplifying the equation:
m = (x / 4y) * 100
m = (x * 100) / (4y)
m = 25x / y

Therefore, m is 25 times x divided by y. To express this as a percentage of x, we need to divide this by x and multiply by 100:
(m / x) * 100
= (25x / y) / x * 100
= (25 / y) * 100
= 2500 / y

Therefore, in terms of y, m is 2500/y. So, the correct answer choice is (D) 2500/y.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 2500/y

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! First, let's write down the given information as equations:

x = m/100 * 4y

Next, to find out in terms of y, what percentage of x m is, we can express m as a percentage of x:

m = (x / 4y) * 100

Now substitute the value of x in terms of m and y obtained from the first equation into the second equation:

m = [(m/100 * 4y) / 4y] * 100

m = (m/100) * 100

m = m

Therefore, we have found that m is 100% of x. So, the answer is not among the choices provided.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Not available as an answer among the given choices because m is 100% of x based on the calculations performed.

For dinner, the man has 8 different types of vegetables to choose from, so there are 8 ways to choose a vegetable for dinner.

To find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of ways for breakfast by the number of ways for dinner:

Total ways = 6 (ways for breakfast) * 8 (ways for dinner) = 48

Therefore, the answer is (C) 48.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 48.

Q: There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The formula for the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by:

P(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k),

where:
- n is the total number of trials (in this case, 5 voters),
- k is the number of successes we want (in this case, 4 voters),
- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.9 or 90%).

Using this formula, we can calculate the probability of exactly 4 out of 5 voters having voted in the last election:

P(X = 4) = (5 choose 4) * 0.9^4 * (1-0.9)^(5-4).

Calculate (5 choose 4):
(5 choose 4) = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5.

Now, substitute into the formula:
P(X = 4) = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1.

Calculate 0.9^4:
0.9^4 ≈ 0.6561.

Finally, compute the probability:
P(X = 4) ≈ 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1 ≈ 0.328 ≈ 32.8%.

Therefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five randomly chosen voters voted in the last election is 32.8%. The answer choice is (B) 32.8%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 32.8%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The formula for calculating the probability of getting exactly \( k \) successes in \( n \) trials, when the probability of success in each trial is \( p \), is given by:

\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} \times p^k \times (1-p)^{n-k} \]

Where:
\( n = 5 \) (number of trials in this case)
\( k = 4 \) (number of successes we want to calculate the probability for)
\( p = 0.9 \) (probability of success - in this case, a voter having voted in the last election)

Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ P(X = 4) = \binom{5}{4} \times 0.9^4 \times (1-0.9)^{5-4} \]

\[ P(X = 4) = 5 \times 0.6561 \times 0.1 \]

\[ P(X = 4) = 0.32805 \]

Approximating to one decimal place: \( P(X = 4) \approx 0.3 \)

Therefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five voters voted in the last election is 32.8%.

So the correct answer choice is (B) 32.8%.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 32.8%

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To calculate the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election, we can use the binomial probability formula.

The formula for the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials, where the probability of success in each trial is p, is given by:
P(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

In this case:
- n = 5 (number of registered voters chosen)
- k = 4 (number of voters who voted in the last election)
- p = 0.90 (probability that a registered voter voted in the last election)
- 1-p = 0.10 (probability that a registered voter did not vote in the last election)

Therefore, the probability of exactly four out of five voters having voted in the last election is:
P(X = 4) = (5 choose 4) * 0.90^4 * 0.10^1 

Using the formula for "n choose k" (combinations), we get:
P(X = 4) = (5! / (4!(5-4)!)) * 0.90^4 * 0.10^1
P(X = 4) = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.10
P(X = 4) = 0.32805 or approximately 32.8%

Therefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election is 32.8%, which corresponds to answer choice (B).

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Answer choice (B) 32.8%.

Q: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Let's denote the length of the yard as L and the width as W.
2. We know that the area of the rectangular yard is 240 square meters, so we have the equation L * W = 240.
3. We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard, excluding one side of 10 meters. This means she needs fencing for 2L + W - 10 meters.
4. To find the total length of fencing needed, we can substitute the given values into the equation from step 3.
5. Once we have the equation for the total length of fencing needed, we can solve for the unknown to find the answer.

Let me know if you need further assistance with any particular step!

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's calculate the total length of fencing needed step by step:

Given that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, we have the equation L * W = 240.

Next, Alice wants fencing around three sides of the yard, excluding one side of 10 meters. This means she needs fencing for 2L + W - 10 meters.

Substitute the value 240 for the area into the first equation to solve for one of the dimensions, either length or width.

Let's assume we solve for the width and obtain W = 240 / L.

Now, substitute W = 240 / L into the second equation for the total length of fencing to get: 2L + (240 / L) - 10.

To find the minimum required length of fencing, minimize the function (ignoring the negative 10 as an offset) by setting its derivative to zero:

d/dL (2L + 240/L) = 0
2 - 240/L^2 = 0
2 = 240/L^2
L^2 = 120
L = sqrt(120) = 10√3

Substitute the value of L back into the total length of fencing equation: 2(10√3) + (240 / 10√3) - 10.
Calculating this value will give the total length of fencing that Alice needs to surround her yard.

Let's now calculate the total length of fencing Alice needs in meters.

Q: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to first understand the dimensions of the rectangular yard based on the given area of 240 square meters. 

Let the length of the yard be x meters and the width be y meters. 

We know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
Area = length x width

Given that the area is 240 square meters, we have:
x * y = 240

We are also given that three sides of the yard will be fenced, which means the total length of fencing needed will be the perimeter of the rectangle minus the side that is left unfenced.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the perimeter will be:
Perimeter = 2 * (x + y)

Given that one side of 10 meters is left unfenced, we know that:
Length of fencing needed = Perimeter - 10 meters

Now we need to solve for x and y using the area equation x * y = 240. Once we find the dimensions of the yard, we can calculate the total length of fencing needed using the perimeter formula.

Would you like to proceed with these calculations step by step to find the answer?

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's proceed step by step to solve the problem:

1. We have the equation for the area of the rectangular yard:
x * y = 240

2. We need to find the dimensions that satisfy this equation in order to calculate the perimeter.

Let's break down the possible dimension combinations that multiply to 240:
1 x 240
2 x 120
3 x 80
4 x 60
5 x 48
6 x 40
8 x 30
10 x 24
12 x 20
Considering these combinations, let's see which one fits the conditions of the problem.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that the yard is rectangular with three sides of equal length that will be fenced and one side of 10 meters left unfenced.
2. The area of the rectangular yard is given as 240 square meters.
3. Let's denote the length of the fenced sides as $x$ meters and the width as $y$ meters.
4. Therefore, the area of the rectangular yard can be represented as $x * y = 240$.
5. Since the yard has three sides fenced, the total length of fencing needed is $2x + y$.
6. We also know that one side is 10 meters.
7. Thus, the perimeter of the yard can be represented as $10 + 2x + y$.
8. By substituting the area given, we get $10 + 2x + y = 240$.
9. Solving the above equation gives $2x + y = 230$.

Now, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ to determine the total fencing needed. Let's solve for $x$ and $y$ to find the total fencing required.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's solve for $x$ and $y$ using the equation $2x + y = 230$ based on the information provided in the problem:

Given that the area of the rectangular yard is $x * y = 240$, and one side is 10 meters long:

Substitute $y = 240/x$ into the equation $2x + y = 230$:
$2x + 240/x = 230$

Multiplying through by $x$ to clear the fraction:
$2x^2 + 240 = 230x$

Rearrange to get a quadratic equation:
$2x^2 - 230x + 240 = 0$

Factorize or use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$ (the width of the yard). Once you find $x$, substitute back into $y = 240/x$ to get the length of the yard. 

Finally, calculate the total fencing needed as $2x + y + 10$.

Once you calculate the total fencing needed using the above steps, you can identify the correct answer choice (A) 58, (B) 62, (C) 66, (D) 70, or (E) 74.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can break it down into different steps:

Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of three consecutive integers that multiply to 727 + 728 + 729. 

First, calculate the sum of 727, 728, and 729:
727 + 728 + 729 = 2184

Now, let's express 2184 as the product of three consecutive integers:
Since we are looking for three consecutive integers, we can represent them as (n-1), n, and (n+1).

So, the product of the three consecutive integers will be:
(n-1) * n * (n+1) = 2184

Expand the expression:
n^3 - n = 2184

Now, try different values of n to get the correct answer:
n = 13 (since 13^3 - 13 = 2184)

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. 
The sum of these integers is:
12 + 13 + 14 = 39

Hence, the correct answer is (E) 39.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 39.

Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the sum of three consecutive integers whose product is $727+728+729$, we can first simplify the right side of the equation:

$727+728+729 = 2184$

Now, let's represent the three consecutive integers as $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$. The product of these integers is:

$(n-1) \times n \times (n+1) = n(n^2-1) = n^3 - n$

Given that this product is equal to 2184, we have:

$n^3 - n = 2184$

Solving this equation will allow us to find the value of $n$ and subsequently calculate the sum of the three integers. Let's continue by solving the equation.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Let's simplify the equation $n^3 - n = 2184$ first. 

$n^3 - n - 2184 = 0$

Next, we need to factor this cubic equation to find the values of $n$.

$n^3 - n - 2184 = (n-12)(n^2 + 12n + 182) = 0$

From this factoring, we find that $n = 12$. The three consecutive integers are 11, 12, and 13.

The sum of these three consecutive integers is $11 + 12 + 13 = 36$.

Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C) 36.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the sum of three consecutive integers whose product is equal to 727 + 728 + 729, we can first calculate the sum of 727, 728, and 729:

727 + 728 + 729 = 2184

Next, we want to represent the required sum as the sum of three consecutive integers. Let's say the three consecutive integers are n-1, n, and n+1:

(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n = 2184

Now, solve for n:

3n = 2184
n = 2184 / 3
n = 728

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 727, 728, and 729. The sum of these integers is:

727 + 728 + 729 = 2184

Hence, the correct answer is the sum of these integers, which is 2184.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To find the capacity of the tank, we need to calculate its volume, which is given by the formula: volume = length × width × height.

Given:
Length = 8 m
Width = 6 m
Height = 2.5 m

Now, substitute the values into the formula:
Volume = 8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m
Volume = 120 m³

Now, to convert the volume from cubic meters to litres, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 cubic meter = 1000 litres):
Volume in litres = 120 m³ × 1000 litres/m³
Volume in litres = 120,000 litres

So, the capacity of the tank is 120,000 litres, which is option (D) 120,000 litres.

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the capacity of the tank, we need to calculate the volume of the tank, which is given by the formula: Volume = length × width × height.

Given that the tank has dimensions of 8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m, we can plug these values into the formula:

Since 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters, we need to convert the volume from cubic meters to liters:

Volume = 120 cubic meters × 1000 liters = 120,000 liters.

Therefore, the capacity of the tank is 120,000 liters, which corresponds to answer choice (D) 120,000 litres.

Q: It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To tackle this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

First, let's find the distance from home to work. The distance is calculated by the formula: distance = speed * time.
Given that the worker takes 9 minutes to drive at 20 km/h:
Distance = 20 km/h * 9 min = 180 km (This is the total distance from home to work.)

Now, let's calculate the time it would take for the worker to cycle at 6 km/h to cover the same 180 km distance:
Time = distance / speed
Time = 180 km / 6 km/h = 30 hours (This is the time it would take for the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route.)

Now, since the answer choices are in minutes, convert 30 hours to minutes:
30 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1800 minutes

Therefore, the worker would take 1800 minutes to cycle from home to work along the same route. The answer choice closest to this calculation is:
(A) 30, which is the correct answer.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 30

Q: It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Step 1: Determine the distance between home and work.
Since the worker drives at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour and takes 9 minutes to get to work, we can calculate the distance by using the formula:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 20 km/h × 9/60 h (converting 9 minutes to hours)
Distance = 3 km

Step 2: Calculate the time it will take the worker to cycle from home to work at 6 km/h.
Now that we know the distance is 3 km, we can calculate the time it will take the worker to cycle at 6 km/h using the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 3 km / 6 km/h
Time = 0.5 hours (converting hours to minutes, 0.5 hours × 60)
Time = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take the worker 30 minutes to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour. So the correct answer choice is (A) 30.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 30

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the worker driving from home to work at 20 km/h:
time = distance / speed
time = 20 km / 20 km/h
time = 1 hour = 60 minutes

Therefore, it takes the worker 60 minutes to drive from home to work.

Now, let's calculate the time it would take for the worker to cycle from home to work at 6 km/h:
time = distance / speed
time = 20 km / 6 km/h
time ≈ 3.33 hours ≈ 3 hours and 20 minutes

Therefore, it would take the worker approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes to cycle from home to work along the same route.

Let's convert 3 hours and 20 minutes to minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 20 minutes = 180 minutes + 20 minutes = 200 minutes

So, the correct answer is not among the choices provided. The closest answer to 200 minutes is  (E) 40.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 40

Q: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to figure out the rates at which P and Q eat the candies individually, and then combine those rates to find out how long it will take them to finish the entire jar when eating together.

Let's represent P's eating rate as 1/10 jar per minute and Q's eating rate for half the jar as 1/5 jar per 5 minutes.

Now, when P and Q eat together, their combined eating rate will be the sum of their individual rates. Since P's rate is 1/10 jar per minute and Q's rate for half the jar is 1/5 jar per 5 minutes (which means 1/10 jar per minute), the combined rate will be 1/10 + 1/10 = 1/5 jar per minute.

Therefore, P and Q eating together can empty the jar in 5 minutes.

So, the answer is (B) 5.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 5

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we can calculate the rate at which each friend eats candies per minute. Let's denote P's rate as \(P\) and Q's rate as \(Q\).

From the question, we know that if P ate alone, he would finish the jar in 10 minutes. Therefore, \(P = \frac{1}{10}\) (P's rate is 1 jar per 10 minutes).

If Q ate alone, she would finish half the jar in 5 minutes, so her rate is \(Q = \frac{1}{(5 \times 2)} = \frac{1}{10}\) (Q's rate is 1/10 jar per minute).

When they eat together, their rates add up. Therefore, the combined rate when they eat together is \(P + Q = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}\) (combined rate is 1/5 jar per minute).

This means they will finish the jar in 5 minutes when eating together. Therefore, the answer is \((B) 5\) minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 5

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which P and Q eat the candies and then determine how long it would take them to empty the jar working together.

Let's start by calculating the rates of eating for P and Q individually:

P can finish the whole jar in 10 minutes
So, P can eat 1/10 of the jar in 1 minute

Q would take 5 minutes to finish half the jar
Therefore, Q can eat 1/10 of the jar in 1 minute (half the jar in 5 minutes)

Since they are eating together, their rates of eating will add up:
Combined rate = P's rate + Q's rate
Combined rate = 1/10 + 1/10 (since they both have the same rate)

This simplifies to:
Combined rate = 2/10
Combined rate = 1/5

So, together P and Q can eat 1/5 of the jar in 1 minute.

To empty the whole jar, they would need to eat 1 whole jar.
Since they eat 1/5 of the jar in 1 minute, they will empty the jar in:
5 minutes (1 / 1/5) = 5 minutes

Therefore, it will take P and Q 5 minutes to empty the jar together.

Therefore, the answer choice is (B) 5 minutes.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 5

Q: A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make? Answer Choices: (A) 125 (B) 150 (C) 225 (D) 250 (E) 275
A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! To calculate the selling price per bag of ice with a 20% profit margin, we first need to determine the cost price. 

Let x be the cost price:
Selling price = Cost price + Profit
$1.25 = x + 0.20x
$1.25 = 1.20x
x = $1.25 / 1.20
x = $1.042 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Therefore, the cost price of one bag of ice is $1.042.

To find the total profit from selling 500 bags of ice:
Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price
Profit per bag = $1.25 - $1.042
Profit per bag = $0.208

Total profit = Profit per bag * Number of bags
Total profit = $0.208 * 500
Total profit = $104

Thus, the total profit the grocery makes by selling 500 bags of ice is $104. So the answer is not provided in the choices given.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is Not provided in the choices given. Would you like me to provide an alternative answer for you?

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
To find the total profit made by selling 500 bags of ice, we first need to calculate the profit made from selling one bag of ice.

The grocery makes a 20% profit on each bag of ice that it sells. This means that the selling price of the bag of ice is 120% of the cost price. 

Let's first calculate the cost price of one bag of ice:
Cost price of one bag of ice = $1.25 / 1.20 = $1.042

Now, the profit made from selling one bag of ice is:
Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price = $1.25 - $1.042 = $0.208

So, the total profit made from selling 500 bags of ice is:
Total profit = Profit per bag X Number of bags sold = $0.208 X 500 = $104

Therefore, the total profit made by the grocery store is $104. The closest answer choice is (A) 125, but the correct answer is (E) $104.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 104

A: Let's think step by step, how to break down the mathematical operations involved in each problem and identify the key concepts to solve them accurately.
Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25.
2. The grocery makes a 20% profit on each bag of ice. To calculate the profit per bag, we need to find 20% of $1.25, which is 0.20 * $1.25 = $0.25. This means the grocery makes $0.25 profit on each bag of ice sold.
3. If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, the total profit can be calculated by multiplying the profit per bag ($0.25) by the number of bags sold (500). Total profit = $0.25 * 500 = $125.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 125.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 125
